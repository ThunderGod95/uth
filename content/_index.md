During the Kunlun Era, the nine great sects that divide the realm are locked in fierce, clandestine struggles to claim the title of the new Alliance Leader. Meanwhile, beyond the borders, the barbarian tribes of the Sa Cult are mounting a violent resurgence... Amidst this era of chaos, as the fates of ordinary people rise and fall like the tides, a new generation of brilliant heroes emerges from the nine factions. Together, their journeys weave a sweeping epic of the great Jianghu, ultimately driving a fractured world toward grand unification.
