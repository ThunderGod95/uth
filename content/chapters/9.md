# Chapters 9: Seeking the Dao and Searching for Buddha

Kunlun Year 83, autumn, eight month.

Juekong returned to Shaolin, putting an end to a farce. It was said that the five leaders of the secular monks, including Zide, were all severely reprimanded.

However, the hidden troubles of Shaolin did not end with the farce; or rather, the conflict between the orthodox and secular monks, which began with the brawl in the dining hall, had now completely shifted into a struggle in the shadows.

And the other hidden trouble of Shaolin Temple...

※

Juesheng knew he would not survive the winter.

Life and death were minor matters, and he faced them calmly. He simply recalled the earnest words of the previous abbot when he accepted the position twenty-two years ago, the focus of which was a single sentence:

"Suppress the secular monks, and promote the orthodox monks."

However, he did not think this way. The lesson of the Shao-Song Conflict was not far behind; without the secular monks to assist in administrative affairs, Shaolin would likely fall into decline. 

Although there were capable men like Juejian and Jueru among the orthodox monks, how easy was it to find someone who was both a master of Buddhist scripture and possessed skillful methods? Take Jueyun, for instance; esteemed as the First Seat of the Unique Wisdom Court, he was perfect in upholding the precepts and relentless in his practice, but his personality was rigid and inflexible.

He had an excess of intelligence but no worldly wisdom. Apart from managing the scriptures and martial classics in the Unique Wisdom Court, if he were sent to the Earth Treasury Court, he probably couldn't even handle the mundane duties of a Hall Monk.

Thus, after succeeding as abbot, he had instead vigorously promoted secular monks, striving for fairness between the orthodox and secular factions. He had thought this would eliminate the barrier between them, but he never expected that not only did the conflict not subside under his tenure, it actually intensified. In the few short years since Liaoxin's disappearance, it had become utterly unmanageable.

Where had he gone wrong?

He let out a sigh. This seventy-year-old monk had lived a life of compassion, and even as his end drew near, confined to his sickbed, he still worried for Shaolin's future.

It was time to appoint a new abbot. Among the Four Courts and Eight Halls, who was the best candidate?

Juekong's ability was beyond doubt; these past years, it was through his efforts that the orthodox and secular monks had remained at peace. Juekong had Shaolin's best interests at heart, yet he was a secular monk. His comprehension of Buddhist doctrine was likely inferior even to that of a Hall Monk from the Unique Wisdom Court. He had already broken enough rules. If he were to also break the rule of passing the abbotship only to an orthodox monk, letting a monk who was not a monk become abbot, would Shaolin still have the right to call itself the true lineage of Buddhism?

If secular monks were not to be considered, then the choice must be made from among the six orthodox monks.

In terms of seniority, experience, and spiritual practice, Jueguan was the ideal choice. But this Inside Blade, if he were made abbot, would likely only intensify the conflict between the orthodox and secular monks. And he seemed to take it as his personal mission to suppress the secular monks; last month's foolishness was instigated by his meddling. A man like that...

Juesheng shook his head; Jueguan was absolutely not an option. Next was Jueyun... Jueyun was not skilled in worldly affairs. Jueming was too indecisive. Jueguang... with the Tongue-Plucking Bodhisattva's penchant for cold sarcasm, if he were to become abbot, who knew how many sects he would offend at future Kunlun councils...

Since the three monks of the Unique Wisdom Court were not viable, the only ones left were Juejian and Liaozheng. Liaozheng lacked seniority and the fortitude to shoulder great responsibility; Steamed Bun could not bear the weight of the Shaolin Temple. That left only Juejian. Juejian…

Although Juejian was prejudiced against secular monks, he had always prioritized the greater good. When the secular monks' names were to be changed, he and Jueming were the only two orthodox monks who opposed it. Compared to Jueming's indecisiveness, although Juejian was not a skilled strategist, he was decisive. If only he and Juekong could cooperate well...

At this thought, a tightness seized Juesheng's chest, and he could not help but cough several times.

He knew that Juejian and Juekong had never gotten along.

If only Jueru were still here... if only Jueru were still here... Juesheng lamented. If Jueru had not advocated for changing the secular monks' names, had not been exiled because of the Liaojing affair, this skilled and diplomatic orthodox monk might have been the best candidate to succeed as abbot.

There was, in fact, another person, perhaps the true ideal candidate, and that was Juewen, who was in the Observing Sufferings Court with Jueru. Juewen was a secular monk, but he was diligent in his practice. Juekong would not only refrain from making things difficult for him, but would in fact plan and strategize on his behalf. He was not as partisan as Juekong, associated with few people, and had not formed factions among the secular monks. Compared to the opposition Juekong might face, the only person who would be displeased by Juewen becoming abbot would likely be Jueguan.

But Juewen had a gentle temperament. If he became abbot, he would inevitably become Juekong's puppet. This was a small matter, and perhaps even a good thing.

Unfortunately... Juewen was, after all, a secular monk.

It was time to decide. Juesheng summoned the attendant monk to prepare ink, a brush, and gold-lacquered cinnabar paper, and then summoned the first seats of the Four Courts.

"After I die, Juejian will succeed me as abbot," Juesheng said, his voice growing weaker. "Do the four first seats have any objections?"

Jueguan knew from the start that he was not a candidate. He had originally hoped for Jueru to become abbot, but Jueru had been exiled over the Liaojing case, a matter that greatly displeased him, which was why he had made trouble for Liaoping. However, Juejian was also an orthodox monk and had always been at odds with Juekong, so Juejian was an acceptable choice for abbot.

Jueyun had no desire to leave the Unique Wisdom Court. As long as a secular monk was not the successor, he would be happy with the outcome.

Zide was a man who only followed orders; as long as Juekong approved, he would follow suit.

As for Juekong...

Juekong understood the abbot's line of thinking; Juejian becoming the new abbot was well within his expectations. He was a choice that was neither good nor particularly bad. He would not change the predicament of Shaolin Temple, nor would he cause anything worse to happen. Juekong was not concerned. The one who solved Shaolin's problems had always been him, and after him, it would be his successor, not any abbot.

So he simply gave a light nod. Seeing him nod, Zide followed with his assent.

Juesheng wrote down Juejian's name, stamped it with the abbot's seal in gold lacquer, and handed it to First Seat Jueyun of the Unique Wisdom Court to be taken to the Abbot's Court for safekeeping, to be taken out and announced only after his passing.

Jueyun departed first. After saying a few words wishing the abbot to take care of his health, Jueguan left with Zide, leaving only Juekong behind. Seeing that Juekong had not yet left, Juesheng knew he had something to say and asked, "Does First Seat Juekong have anything more to add?"

"If you were not going to kill Jueru, you should not have exiled him," Juekong said. "Pushing all the blame onto Liaojing and single-mindedly protecting Jueru, you would not have ended up in such a difficult position today."

Lying on the bed, Juesheng gazed at the ceiling and said faintly, "If I had not exiled Jueru, the secular monks would not have been satisfied."

Juekong said coldly, "Are the secular monks satisfied now? Are the orthodox monks satisfied? This people-pleasing nature of yours has not changed in decades."

Juesheng sighed. "Not everyone can be as decisive as you. Beyond right and wrong, there is still the hurdle in one's heart."

"Your hurdle, is it the Buddha, or is it Shaolin?"

"Both," Juesheng said. "Must you still argue with me at a time like this?"

Juekong quietly looked at the man before him. Juesheng was fourteen years his senior. They had been well acquainted long before he had taken his vows. At that time, Juesheng was the First Seat of the Observing Sufferings Court, and he was an In-Hall Layman of the Hall of Upright Action.

Whenever Juesheng encountered difficulties in administrative matters, he would seek his advice. After Juekong entered the hall, not only did Juesheng not suppress him because of his status as a secular monk, but he promoted him all the way to First Seat of the Universal Virtue Court. They had weathered decades of storms together and shared a deep bond. As he was not an orthodox monk, he could not be so philosophical about matters of life and death. For a moment, his ramrod-straight posture wavered slightly.

Even so, he still said what needed to be said: "You should have chosen Juewen. Even Jueguan would have been better."

"If you truly disagreed, why did you not object just now?"

"If I could persuade you, Jueru would have been dead long ago." 

Juekong's brows lowered as he spoke, "Abbot, take care."

He then rose to leave.

Juesheng suddenly said, "It is time for you to find a successor as well."

Juekong stopped in his tracks, as if in thought.

"You have always known what to do," Juesheng said.

Juekong nodded and strode away with his head held high.

Juesheng gazed at Juekong's departing back and sighed once more.

Meanwhile, Jueyun carried the gold-lacquered cinnabar paper to the Abbot's Court, the official workplace of the abbot. He closed the door, surveyed his surroundings to confirm he was alone, and walked over to a small statue of the Maitreya Buddha on the desk. Reaching out, he turned it. A hidden compartment emerged from the desk. This was where the Yijin Jing was kept, a mechanism known only to the abbot and the First Seat of the Unique Wisdom Court in the entire Shaolin Temple.

Jueyun placed the gold-lacquered cinnabar paper into the hidden compartment, turned the Buddha statue again, and the compartment closed, appearing just as it had before.

※

Juekong left the Great Hall of Heroes, understanding Juesheng's worries and expectations. The succeeding abbot, Juejian, was fifty-seven this year and would be the last of the 'Jue' generation to hold the high seat of Shaolin. After him would be the 'Liao' generation monks. Although Liaoping was efficient, he lacked vigilance and was short on strategic thinking, which was why he had been so easily manipulated by Jueguan.

On his recent trip to Diancang, he noted that they had always passed leadership to the eldest son rather than the most virtuous, a rarity among the Nine Great Families. Qingcheng and Mount Hua passed it to the most virtuous descendant; Tang Gate chose the most virtuous from among the sons and nephews; Shaolin, Wudang, and the Beggar's Sect all had their leaders appointed by the previous head; Mount Heng's leader was recommended by the sect head and approved by the elders; and Kongtong's was jointly elected by the sixteen seats of their council hall. Only Diancang still clung to the old rules. The new head of Diancang was the former head's eldest son, Zhuge Yan. He could tell at a glance that this man had a flamboyant personality and was eager for grand achievements. His younger brother, Zhuge Ran, however, would be a formidable character.

Selecting a successor required the utmost care. The abbot wanted him to find a successor, one who did not represent the secular monks, or even one who represented neither the orthodox nor the secular factions. Or perhaps, a monk who could represent both.

To cultivate an orthodox disciple, to raise him as Ziqiu had raised him, and to pass on everything he had to him.

He had to be able to gain the trust of the orthodox monks, yet possess sufficient skill to control the secular monks.

Liaojing was a talent, but alas, he was ruined by Jueru.

Another talent...

He thought of Ming Buxiang.

※

Juekong summoned Ming Buxiang. Their conversation was simple. After a few pleasantries, Juekong asked Ming Buxiang, "What are your thoughts on the matter of your master, Liaoxin?"

"I think that Master may not be coming back."

Juekong asked again, "Do you think the temple's handling of your master's case was appropriate?"

Juekong was naturally referring to the final verdict from the Universal Virtue Court: death resulting from a fighting, pending further investigation of suspicious circumstances.

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "Inappropriate."

Juekong asked again, "Then what would be appropriate?"

"Liaoxin killed someone. A warrant should be issued for his arrest."

"But that is your master. Before the truth is known, you would say he is a murderer?"

"Master would not want to see Shaolin fall into conflict between the orthodox and secular factions because of him," Ming Buxiang said. "It is just a warrant for his arrest, not an immediate execution. If Master is found, the truth can be found. Even if Master remains missing as he is now, it would only be considered an unresolved case."

Juekong nodded, satisfied with Ming Buxiang's answer, and asked again, "Have you decided to take the tonsure?"

"Not yet," Ming Buxiang said. "This disciple wishes to leave Shaolin."

※

Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, Ming Buxiang paid a visit to Juejian. This was the first time he had taken the initiative to visit him.

"You want to leave Shaolin?"

"Yes."

"You are all alone. Where will you go?"

"Don't the masters often say, 'Follow your heart, follow the Buddha'?"

"You have only just turned sixteen. It is too early to leave Shaolin," Juejian said. "The Repository of Divine Arts still holds many precious martial arts texts and numerous scriptures that you have not yet fully learned."

"Compared to the world, the collection in the Unique Wisdom Court is small," Ming Buxiang said. "Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, and unify knowledge and action."

Juejian remembered that Juekong had once summoned Ming Buxiang, and grew suspicious. "Did First Seat Juekong say something to you?"

"The first seat only asked if I wished to take the tonsure."

"And what did you say?"

"This disciple also said he wished to leave Shaolin."

Juejian sighed. "I had thought you would stay in the temple and become a monk."

"This disciple has grown up in Shaolin since childhood; Shaolin is my home. If I take the tonsure in Shaolin, am I leaving home or staying home?"

Juejian detected the hidden meaning in Ming Buxiang's words and smiled. "You mean to say that without having seen the world, there is no point in becoming a monk?"

"For the World-Honored One to attain enlightenment, he too had to endure the disturbances of celestial demons."

Juejian laughed, "Are you going to be tested by the celestial demons?"

It's not certain that I won't be the celestial demon testing others."

Juejian laughed heartily. He looked at the youth before him, who had grown even more upright and handsome than when they first met three years ago. Ming Buxiang possessed a pure and good nature, was gifted with intelligence, and had a deep understanding of Buddhist doctrine. 

If he could remain in the temple, it would be a blessing for the orthodox monks. He had intended to temper him well, but as Ming Buxiang said, staying in Shaolin Temple would ultimately limit his experience of the world. Even if he became a monk, he would most likely become a rigid and dogmatic orthodox monk.

Rather than that, it would be better to let him witness the dangers of the martial world and the unpredictability of the human heart. If he could become more worldly, perhaps upon his return to Shaolin, he could become a pillar of support for the future orthodox monks. In the end, the predicament Shaolin faced today was truly due to the lack of a capable and shrewd figure like Juekong among the orthodox monks.

"There are many worldly customs out there that cannot be compared to those in the temple. The ways of the world are treacherous; you must be careful."

"This disciple understands."

"When do you plan to leave?" Juejian asked again.

"Perhaps tomorrow, or perhaps in a few years. I will follow my heart."

Juejian nodded in assent, then asked, "Is there anything else you wish to say?"

Ming Buxiang added, "This disciple has one more question."

Juejian smiled. "What is it?"

"Abbot, in your opinion, how can the conflict between the orthodox and secular monks be resolved?"

"Why the sudden question?" The question caught Juejian off guard. He thought for a moment and replied, "If the orthodox and secular factions each fulfill their roles, the conflict can be resolved."

"What are the roles of the orthodox and secular monks?" Ming Buxiang asked again.

"It is the duty of the secular monks to assist the orthodox monks, and the duty of the orthodox monks to focus on their spiritual practice." At this, Juejian added, "But the simple act of accepting one's role is not easy. Why do you ask this?" he asked again.

Ming Buxiang replied, "I was just moved by the strife within the temple and felt at a loss, so I thought the abbot might have some insight."

Juejian smiled. "If I had any insight, the temple wouldn't be in such turmoil."

"The abbot speaks of roles, but the Buddhist scriptures say that all beings have Buddha-nature. Since all have Buddha-nature, all can practice. Why then can secular monks not practice?"

"It is not that secular monks cannot practice. Abbot Juewen is a secular monk who abides by his role, diligent in temple affairs without neglecting his practice. But such people are as rare as a phoenix's feather or a qilin's horn."

"Practice is equal for all. Shouldn't the orthodox monks be helping the secular monks with their practice even more?"

Juejian laughed heartily. "If they were willing to practice, would Shaolin Temple lack for teachers? When has First Seat Zide ever asked about spiritual practice? Who knows how many children he has fathered since becoming a monk. They are unwilling to practice, so how can they blame others?"

Ming Buxiang said, "Can Buddha and Shaolin truly not be separated? Form and name are illusions, Shaolin is an illusion, and the Buddha is also an illusion. To use illusion to measure illusion, is that not attachment and delusion?"

Juejian exclaimed in shock, "Xiang'er, your words are utterly muddled. Shaolin was founded on Buddhism; it is the sanctuary for all Buddhists under heaven. If, because of the secular monks, we orthodox monks were to withdraw from Shaolin, then Mount Heng would follow suit, and in time, monks would retreat from all the ancient and famous temples. Where then would there be temples in the world, and where would there be the Sangha Jewel? You must know that although form and name are illusions, the Sangha Jewel is real. Without the Three Jewels, the Dharma will perish, and if the Dharma perishes, when will all sentient beings ever find liberation?"

He spoke sternly, but Ming Buxiang showed no alarm, merely prostrating himself on the ground and saying, "Thank you, Abbot, for your guidance. This disciple understands."

Juejian nodded. "You are young, and your thinking is naturally incomplete. This is a small matter. Abbot Jueming holds you in high regard. You have swept the floors in the Hall of True Insight for several years and served as an In-Hall Layman there. You should let him know before you leave."

Ming Buxiang agreed, bowed, and took his leave, heading straight for the Hall of True Insight.

Jueming was also very surprised to learn that Ming Buxiang was leaving Shaolin.

"Have you thought it through? You have only just turned sixteen."

"This disciple has considered it deeply."

Jueming nodded. "Very well, very well. Causes and conditions bring things together; when the conditions are met, we gather, and when they cease, we part. You must remember: do no evil, and practice all that is good."

"What is evil, and what is good?"

Jueming smiled. "With your intelligence, how could you not know how to distinguish between good and evil?"

Ming Buxiang asked again, "With the wisdom of the World-Honored One, how is good distinguished from evil?"

Jueming said, "The three deeds of the body, the four deeds of the mouth, and the three deeds of the mind. These ten deeds result in evil karma."

What Jueming spoke of were the ten evils described in the Buddhist scriptures: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, which are the three deeds of the body; lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter, which are the four deeds of the mouth; and greed, ill will, and wrong views, which are the three deeds of the mind.

Ming Buxiang said, "When the World-Honored One looks upon all beings with his wisdom, they are no different from dust and sand. So-called good and evil are but the squabbles of mayflies. Man does not care about the life and death of a mayfly; does the World-Honored One care about the good and evil of all beings?"

Jueming said, "If the World-Honored One did not care, why would he have left his teachings in the world? The Buddha's compassion is such that he cares for even a single mayfly."

Ming Buxiang asked again, "Cultivation takes countless kalpas. For a bodhisattva to become a Buddha requires three great asamkhyeya kalpas. In this vast expanse of time, a human life is like the snap of a finger. Is the good and evil of that single snap important?"

Jueming said, "Even a single thought is important, let alone a lifetime."

"If that single thought is difficult to control, is it also a matter of one's own karma?"

Jueming smiled. "That is a matter of course."

Ming Buxiang bowed. "This disciple has been taught."

Ming Buxiang returned to the Hall of True Speech to handle his miscellaneous duties, just as he always did, seeming in no hurry to leave.

※

Abbot Liaoping of the Hall of True Speech lived up to his nickname, 'Stone.' Even with a broken leg, he conducted his duties as usual, though he was deeply shaken, starting at shadows and constantly wary of Jueguan's schemes. But whether it was because the eternal flame before the Buddha had been extinguished, or because he was concerned about affecting the abbot's health, Jueguan had been quiet this month.

One day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, Ming Buxiang reported on the temple's lamp oil situation, noting where it needed to be replenished and where it was lacking. Liaoping offered him a box of mooncakes, saying, "Take these mooncakes."

According to custom, during major festivals, the Four Courts and Eight Halls of Shaolin received many gifts from local prominent families and major martial world sects, as well as wealthy merchants, all for the sake of maintaining good relations. The disposal of these gifts varied according to the abbot's personality. Liaoping, newly arrived at the Hall of True Speech, had suffered greatly in matters of human relations, so he distributed all the Mid-Autumn gifts among the Hall Monks to win their loyalty.

But Ming Buxiang did not accept, shaking his head. "My master said that gifts are debts and should not be accepted."

Liaoping was surprised. "How so?"

"Gifts are usually given with a request. If not repaid today, it must be repaid tomorrow. Naturally, it is a debt, not a gift."

Liaoping laughed heartily. "Human relations are just you helping me and me helping you. Why must there be so many reasons? I hear that Master Juejian of the Hall of Upright Action does not accept gifts; I suppose he thinks the same as you."

Ming Buxiang asked, "Does the abbot find this inappropriate?"

Liaoping said, "These gifts contain not only karma but also a convenient means. If you refuse people, they will not dare to seek you out in the future, and when you need help, you will not find anyone. Is that not troublesome?"

Ming Buxiang said, "Abbot Juejian never asks for help."

"He is an orthodox monk, and the Hall of Upright Action is in charge of punishment, emphasizing impartiality. Naturally, he can refuse gifts. The Hall of True Speech must interact with people; it is very different."

Ming Buxiang nodded, then suddenly changed the subject. "Abbot, why did you come to Shaolin?"

Liaoping was puzzled. "What do you mean by that?"

"With the abbot's talents, you could have made a name for yourself even without taking the tonsure at Shaolin."

"So that's what you're asking," Liaoping said with a smile. "I am from Shanxi, and my master was also a Shaolin monk, so naturally I entered Shaolin."

Ming Buxiang nodded and asked again, "This disciple had an old friend named Fu Yingcong, who was also from Shanxi. Must people from Shanxi join Shaolin?"

"Not necessarily, but it is better than joining Mount Hua. Mount Hua has a bad reputation, and the position of sect leader is hereditary, unlike Shaolin. And Wudang is even farther away."

Ming Buxiang asked, "Is there not also Mount Song?"

"Being a Daoist priest is not much different from being a monk. Besides, Mount Song is still beneath Shaolin."

Ming Buxiang sighed. "If only one could join Shaolin without having to take the tonsure, how wonderful that would be."

Liaoping sighed. "Yes, if only one did not have to take the tonsure, that would be good. My wife and children are still in Hebei, waiting for me to bring them to the Buddha Capital."

Ming Buxiang said again, "In that case, wouldn't it be good for the secular monks to change their names? Once the distinction between orthodox and secular is drawn, there will be corresponding precepts for each. Perhaps many years from now, one will be able to enter the halls without taking the tonsure."

Liaoping gave a hollow laugh. "Difficult. Even now, the orthodox monks look down on the secular monks. If they change their Dharma names, at best it creates a distinction between them, but at worst, the secular monks might end up with the same status as In-Hall Laymen. If you really want to change the rules, why not start by changing the one that says only monks can enter the halls? They believe that those who live in the temple must ultimately be monks."

Ming Buxiang nodded. "So that is how it is. Those who live in the temple must ultimately be monks."

Liaoping said, "Why are you asking about this?"

"This disciple was just thinking that perhaps the orthodox and secular monks could coexist peacefully."

Liaoping thought to himself: 'Let the secular monks do the work while the orthodox monks occupy the high positions. It would be a wonder if they could coexist peacefully.'

Although he had gotten to know Ming Buxiang well over the past few months and knew that First Seat Juekong had met with him alone, he could not bring himself to say these words. He could only say, "Let us hope so."

※

In the afternoon of the tenth day of the ninth month, perhaps due to a final surge of vitality, Juesheng felt his spirits were strong and got up to walk around.

He first went to the Great Hall of Heroes, paid his respects to the Buddha, and recited the Diamond Sutra once. Then he strolled in the central courtyard. His death was near, so he was not bothered with the temple's mundane affairs, which were handled by each court. The council of the Four Courts had not been convened for three months. 

With some leisure time, he suddenly remembered the matter of the eternal flame before the Buddha extinguishing two months ago and walked around to the back of the Great Hall of Heroes to check if the oil was sufficient.

Just as he rounded the corner of the hall, he saw a youth climbing a ladder, peering into the oil tank, a head of black hair cascading over his shoulders. Seeing how young he was, Juesheng asked out of curiosity, "Who are you?"

Upon seeing Juesheng, the youth quickly climbed down from the tank and pressed his palms together.

"Disciple Ming Buxiang pays his respects to the Abbot."

"So you are Ming Buxiang?" Juesheng had long heard of this person. He had passed the martial trial before the age of sixteen, had lasted thirty moves against First Seat Juekong, and had served as an In-Hall Layman in both the Hall of True Insight and the Hall of True Speech. He was truly a promising youth. Seeing his clear, handsome features, he took a liking to him and asked, "What are you doing?"

"This disciple is an In-Hall Layman of the Hall of True Speech, responsible for monitoring the temple's oil supply. I came specifically to inspect it."

"You come every day?" Juesheng said. "Once filled, this oil can keep the eternal flame lit for two months. Checking it once every half a month is enough."

Ming Buxiang said, "The eternal flame went out before, which left me feeling uneasy, so I have come to check it every day."

Juesheng smiled. "You certainly have patience."

Ming Buxiang smiled, a smile like a flower in first bloom, like the warm sun after a snow.

"This disciple has always had patience. I have always been waiting, and I will eventually get my chance."

Juesheng said, "A chance for what?"

"When the oil is spent and the lamp is extinguished, a disciple like me will have his chance to be of use."

Juesheng knew he was speaking of the lamp oil, but it seemed to allude to himself. He felt a little uneasy, but he was a kind elder and an eminent monk of the Dao. Furthermore, Ming Buxiang was still a youth; a slip of the tongue could not be blamed on him, so he did not take it to heart, only saying, "I have heard Juejian mention you. You are a person of Buddhist wisdom."

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "There are many things this disciple cannot figure out. I asked Abbot Juejian, and he answered, but I still have my doubts."

"What is it that you doubt? Tell me."

"While handling official duties in the Hall of True Speech, the eternal flame went out. I know it was First Seat Jueguan deliberately making things difficult. When I go to the dining hall, though we are all Shaolin monks, we are clearly divided into two rows of seating. When handling official business in the temple, each side has its own people. Abbot Juejian told me that this is the distinction between the orthodox and the secular."

Juesheng sighed. "That is indeed the case."

"I often wonder why the orthodox and secular factions are so irreconcilable. Abbot, please do not be offended. I originally thought it was because the abbot was unfair, leading to this irreconcilable conflict. But I asked ten of my senior brothers, and all ten said the abbot handles matters with impartiality. If there is impartiality, why is there resentment? I thought about it for a long time and finally understood."

Juesheng asked, "Understood what?"

"The abbot's fairness is in the handling of matters, but the monks' discontent is in their hearts. When matters are settled but hearts are not at peace, that void can never be filled. Instead, resentment grows on both sides."

'Matters are settled but hearts are not at peace'—what a line. What Ming Buxiang said was exactly the same as what Juekong had said.

Ming Buxiang continued, "So I asked Abbot Juejian again, can Buddha and Shaolin truly not be separated? Form and name are illusions, Shaolin is an illusion, and the Buddha is also an illusion. To use illusion to measure illusion, is that not attachment and delusion?"

"And how did Abbot Juejian reply?"

"Abbot Juejian said that Shaolin was founded on Buddhism, and though form and name are illusions, the Sangha Jewel is real. Without the Three Jewels, the Dharma will perish, and if the Dharma perishes, when will all sentient beings ever find liberation?"

Juesheng nodded. Ultimately, the orthodox monks looked down upon the secular monks because the secular monks often violated the precepts. To Buddhism, the Sangha Jewel is one of the Three Jewels, the community of ordained monks who follow the Buddhist teachings and practice accordingly.

To go deeper, the Three Jewels are the foundation of Buddhism. The monastic community must guide all beings toward goodness and reverence for the Buddha. Secular monks wear the robes of the monastic community but lack the substance of the Three Jewels, which is a profound desecration of the doctrine. This is why the orthodox monks cannot tolerate the secular monks. But to ask the secular monks to adhere to the orthodox precepts, how many could be as diligent and disciplined as Juewen?

Juesheng said, "Abbot Juejian speaks with reason. What is it that you do not understand?"

"Without the Buddha, Shaolin would not be Shaolin. But without Shaolin, would the Buddha not be the Buddha?"

Juesheng was taken aback.

Ming Buxiang continued, "To insist that Shaolin must be the orthodox school of Buddhism in the world, is that not a form of arrogance?"

Juesheng said, "That is indeed arrogant. What are your thoughts? Go on."

"Shaolin can exist without the Buddha, and the Buddha can exist without Shaolin. The Buddha is the Buddha, and Shaolin is Shaolin. The Dharma does not flourish because Shaolin flourishes, nor does it perish because Shaolin perishes."

Juesheng said, "To have such insight at the age of sixteen, you are truly gifted. It is no exaggeration to call you a child of heaven."

Ming Buxiang said, "This disciple's greatest asset is not talent, but luck."

"Oh?" Juesheng asked in surprise. "How so?"

"The abbot has been recuperating for several months and has not stepped out of the Great Hall of Heroes. If this disciple were not lucky, how could he have met the abbot?"

Juesheng smiled. "There is reason in that. As for the question you just raised, since Shaolin was born of the Buddha, how can it be abandoned so easily? Since the Dharma exists within Shaolin, Shaolin must naturally promote the Dharma. Shaolin can have the Dharma, and the Dharma can exist within Shaolin."

Ming Buxiang said, "If the Buddha and Shaolin cannot coexist, is it better to have no Buddha, or no Shaolin?"

Juesheng said, "Neither is good."

Ming Buxiang asked again, "Abbot, in the next fifty years, will the Buddha destroy Shaolin, or will Shaolin destroy the Buddha? Or perhaps, will both the Buddha and Shaolin be destroyed?"

Juesheng finally understood Ming Buxiang's meaning. He spoke of 'Shaolin' but not 'Shaolin Temple.' 'Shaolin' referred to the sect, that is, the secular monks, while 'Buddha' referred to the orthodox monks. Would the orthodox monks destroy the secular monks, or would the secular monks destroy the orthodox monks, or would they coexist, or perish together?

Juesheng sighed, "Perhaps in fifty years, it will be as it is today, with both the Buddha and Shaolin coexisting."

"Perhaps the abbot of Shaolin fifty years ago thought the same," Ming Buxiang said.

The words were spoken lightly, but as Juesheng heard them, a flash of insight struck him like a bolt of lightning.

Would the Shaolin of fifty years hence still be the Shaolin of today?

He had painstakingly striven for impartiality, seeking the coexistence of the orthodox and secular, but in the end, it was useless because the hearts of men were not at peace. Fifty years ago, secular monks entered the halls; fifty years from now... He suddenly felt a wave of dizziness, and a suffocating pressure rose from his chest. It was not a question he hadn't considered, but one he had deliberately avoided. Now, as his own lamp was about to run dry, Ming Buxiang's words had provoked his old ailment.

Ming Buxiang quickly asked, "Abbot, what is wrong?"

Juesheng said, "I am fine..."

He dragged his heavy steps back to his room, feeling deeply weary, and lay on his bed in contemplation.

He had long known that the conflict between the orthodox and secular was not impossible to resolve. Mount Heng could achieve coexistence between the two, and so could Shaolin. As long as Shaolin did not claim to be the orthodox school of Buddhism, it could be like any other sect, letting the practitioners practice and the administrators administer.

However, every year on Buddha's Birthday, were not the tens of thousands of pilgrims who came drawn by its reputation as a sacred Buddhist land? He knew this was an empty name, but he did not dare to let it go. He was but one of the dozens of abbots in Shaolin's history; how could he shake this hard-won foundation?

The rule that one must be ordained to enter the halls was not unchangeable. Allowing lay disciples to coexist with practitioners would eliminate the problem of secular monks. As long as the secular monks did not wear monastic robes, there would be no issue of damaging the Sangha Jewel.

He had thought about it, but it was a thousand-year-old tradition, and he was powerless to change it.

He finally understood Juekong's hesitation that day.

He thought he had changed enough, but he had never shaken the foundation. And it was not that he was unaware, only that he did not dare to make the change.

Juesheng's mind was in turmoil, tormented by his thoughts. In his twenty-two years as abbot, he had only left Shaolin with a deeper conflict between the orthodox and secular.

He thought of Juejian...

The challenges he faced, Juejian would still be unable to move. No orthodox monk could change Shaolin; that was determined by their fundamental devotion to the Buddha and their obedience to the rules of Shaolin Temple.

Looking at the present, there was only one person who could do it.

"Summon the Four Courts and Eight Halls. I am convening a council of the Four Courts," he said to the attendant monk. The monk said in surprise, "Abbot, your health..."

"Go quickly!" he instructed once more.

The attendant monk hurried off. He stood up and walked towards the abbot's office.

Only Juekong could do it. Only he had the ability.

The most correct thing he could do for Shaolin was to make Juekong the abbot, to let Juekong thoroughly reform Shaolin, whether it was to shine brightly as a sacred Buddhist land or to grow strong as a martial sect.

He had to persuade all the orthodox monks of the Four Courts and Eight Halls to let Juekong become the abbot.

He hurried to the front of the Abbot's Court, intending to retrieve the gold-lacquered cinnabar paper, when a sharp pain suddenly twisted in his chest. He stumbled and fell to the ground.

He never got up again.

The funeral bells of Shaolin Temple tolled. Monks everywhere looked out, pressing their palms together and chanting the Buddha's name.

That night, as all the monks gathered on the road before the Great Hall of Heroes to pray for the abbot, the scripture repository suddenly caught fire. The monks rushed to save it, but all the martial arts classics and books were consumed by the flames.

No one knew how the fire started.

That night, Ming Buxiang silently left Shaolin, heading west towards Gansu. He had heard that Kongtong Sect was skilled in forging, and he wanted to craft a weapon, and also to see the north.

News of the Shaolin abbot's passing spread quickly, and the leaders of the Nine Great Families came to offer their condolences.

On the road, Ming Buxiang heard the news of Juejian's succession as abbot. He looked up at the sky and saw a bright moon hanging high.

He faced the sky and smiled faintly.

A smile as radiant as peach blossoms, as warm as the morning sun.
