# Chapter 0: Under the Heavens - The Prologue

The last emperor died over a century ago.

Descendants say it was Heaven's will to extinguish a dynasty devoid of the Dao. Beyond the pass, barbarian tribes devoted to the Shamanic faith marched on the Great Wall; within the pass, heavy snows buried Henan in October, locust plagues swept through Hubei, oppressive taxes and famine ran rampant, and the people swapped children for food and split bones for fuel—husbands sold their wives and fathers abandoned their sons, a tragedy too unbearable to witness.

These desperate times forged a heroic figure—

The King of Wrath raged, and the world trembled!

As the verse goes:

Loathing the filth of a tyrant dark and vile,

Resisting the tyrant as apocalyptic fires pile.

Standing between heaven and earth, blade drawn and spear raised high,

A new world born, where the starving no longer die.

The rebel army, composed of heroes from the martial sects, breached the capital, yet immediately following their victory, they faced the formidable Shamanic barbarians and the final Iron Cavalry of the Great Wall led by Great General You Changbo.

In the great battle at Red Cloud Pass, three pivotal figures—the King of Wrath, the Barbarian King, and You Changbo—perished simultaneously.

The Shamanic cultists retreated beyond the pass, while the righteous army was left leaderles. Warlords carved out their own territories, and the martial sects either attached themselves to others or formed strategic alliances, until factions stood as numerous as trees in a forest and the Divine Land was left without a dynasty.

Ten years later, the last warlord, Zuo Liangbi, was besieged by the Four Great Families at Diancang Mountain and killed.

Another twenty years passed before Gu Langya, Sect Leader of the Qingcheng Sect, summoned the Nine Great Families to Kunlun for a grand council to establish the rules of the martial world, decreeing that any who violated them would be destroyed by the collective might of the heroes.

Thereafter, the martial sects existed not merely within their own circles, but encompassed everything Under the Heavens.
