# Chapter 6: The Cause of Liao, the Effect for Jue

Liaojing arrived at the location he had agreed upon with Ming Buxiang, but Ming Buxiang was nowhere to be seen. He waited for a while, yet still, no one came.

'Is he late?' Liaojing wondered, then immediately dismissed the thought. Although he didn't know Ming Buxiang well, a person who could devise such a meticulous plan would never be unpunctual, unless he had an ulterior motive—to make him wait anxiously and affect his judgment in battle.

Anxiety was never a good thing, especially in a life-or-death struggle where a single lapse in concentration between experts could determine the victor.

Liaojing, on the contrary, felt a flicker of reassurance. If this were the case, it meant Ming Buxiang wasn't as powerful as he imagined and needed to provoke him to secure a chance of winning.

He briefly surveyed the terrain. This was the same path where Bensong had been ambushed by Liaowu, flanked by blade-grass that grew past his waist. Yesterday, Ming Buxiang had hidden in these thickets to launch his sneak attack. The path was narrow, only wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side. During the fight here yesterday, Liaowu and his men had attacked together, sometimes even pressing him into the clumps of grass to fight. Of course, he himself had unavoidably gotten some grass on him and had to clean it off before returning to the temple.

He looked up at the sky; it was the ninth day of the month, and though the moonlight was pearly, it was not bright. Just as he was pondering whether to emulate Ming Buxiang and lie in ambush, he suddenly saw what looked like a figure moving up ahead.

The path ahead curved to the left, and while it was visible at a glance, the blade-grass still obscured the lower half of his vision. He took a few steps forward and faintly saw the silhouette. At first, it was just a head, suggesting the person was sitting on the ground. Liaojing quickened his pace, his certainty growing from it being a seated person to that person being Ming Buxiang. As he rounded the bend, he saw Ming Buxiang sitting on top of a prone figure, his right hand cupping his chin as if deep in thought.

Liaojing was startled and demanded in a low, stern voice, "Who is that you're sitting on?"

"Miss Yuan's husband," Ming Buxiang said. "He came by the main road this morning. It took me some effort to move him here."

"You killed him?!" Liaojing exclaimed angrily.

Ming Buxiang retorted, "Didn't you want to kill him?"

"I have no quarrel with him, why would I kill him?" Liaojing said, infuriated.

"Did you want to kill Senior Brother Bensong and Miss Yuan?" Ming Buxiang said.

Liaojing was alarmed. "Are they in your hands?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head again, then thought for a moment before saying, "Once he gets up the mountain and confronts Martial Uncle Liaowu, he'll find out that Senior Brother Bensong seduced a married woman, which is a capital crime. If he dies, his family will just assume he was killed by bandits on his journey and his wife was abducted. Liaowu would have no witness, and Senior Brother Bensong would merely be a fugitive monk. By splitting it into two separate incidents, Senior Brother Bensong will be safe."

Liaojing raged, "When his family comes to the mountain to inquire, Bensong still won't be able to escape!"

"By the time they travel back and forth, ten days to half a month will have passed, and Senior Brother Bensong will be long gone," Ming Buxiang said, then asked again, "Letting him go up the mountain now is tantamount to getting Senior Brother Bensong and Miss Yuan killed, isn't it? Since you intended to kill them, why did you help Senior Brother Bensong escape in the first place?"

Liaojing was stunned. He had acted purely out of a chivalrous impulse to save them. Though he knew Bensong had broken the precepts, he couldn't bear to watch the two of them die.

He said, "Liaowu never intended to let Bensong live. That woman was abused by her husband's family; if this gets out, her future will be ruined as well."

Ming Buxiang said, "If you only save people halfway, why bother saving them at all?"

"It wouldn't have come to this if you hadn't set a trap that led Liaowu to discover them!" Liaojing said angrily.

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "Senior Brother Bensong could have chosen not to leave, but in the end, he did. It was his own decision to go; I didn't force him. He knew that this escape meant being a wanted man for a thousand li, with no peace for the rest of his days, yet they still left. But you could have chosen not to help Senior Brother Bensong. You helped, yet you only helped halfway."

"Even if I were to help, there's no need to kill anyone! With your intelligence, you couldn't think of another way?"

Ming Buxiang nodded. "There are indeed many ways, but for me, this is the best one right now."

Liaojing demanded furiously, "What in the world are you trying to do?!"

Ming Buxiang thought for another moment. He seemed to spend a lot of time thinking, but his expression was not one of plotting; rather, it was as if he were pondering how to describe precisely what he wanted to say. Finally, he said, "It's about what you all want to do."

Liaojing frowned and asked, "What do you mean?"

Ming Buxiang said, "You lack determination. You're indecisive and don't think things through. Who can you possibly save like that?"

Liaojing declared loudly, "I helped Bensong because I couldn't bear to see someone die without offering aid. I help where I can; anything more is beyond my capacity. One must act within their means when saving people, and one cannot harm others in the process."

Ming Buxiang nodded. "I see. So, are you still going to kill me now?"

"If you confess your crimes, accept your punishment in prison, and refrain from stirring up trouble from now on, I will spare you."

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "If you think I'm doing evil, then Benyue is also doing evil. If you're justified in killing me, then I'm justified in driving Benyue mad. You all are doing the same things I am, just not as well."

Liaojing did not continue to entangle himself in a debate with Ming Buxiang. With a great shout, he struck out at him with the Left and Right Flower-Weaving Hands. Ming Buxiang stood up and met the attack with his fists. Liaojing recognized the style as _Deviating Flower Seven Stars Fist_, which, like his own technique, was a lower-hall martial art.

As soon as they engaged, Liaojing’s focus sharpened; he could not afford any distraction, not knowing the depths of this fiend before him. He was the one on the offensive now, his left and right palms striking in succession, alternating between feint and reality, between fore and aft, like a dazzling and bewildering shower of flower petals—a beautiful sight to behold. Ming Buxiang parried and blocked, holding his ground steadily.

After a few exchanges, Liaojing’s confidence surged. While he had not gained the upper hand, there was no obvious gap between them. For his age, Ming Buxiang was indeed astonishing, but he was still only fifteen. Even if he had trained since childhood, it would be for ten years at most. He himself had begun his martial training at seven; his twenty years of cultivation was not just a ten-year difference, but twice the duration.

After completing the sixteen stances of the Left and Right Flower-Weaving Palm, he took a deep breath. The form of his palms remained unchanged, but the force behind them grew more vigorous. When Ming Buxiang blocked the next blow, he actually stumbled back several steps.

Taking advantage of those few steps, Liaojing drew another long, fine breath, and then unleashed a palm strike of staggering power.

The Left and Right Flower-Weaving Palm was a technique he favored because its lethality was low, allowing him to fight without taking lives, but his most profound upper-hall martial art was the one he was using now: the Great Sumeru Palm.

The Great Sumeru Palm alluded to Mount Sumeru from the Buddhist scriptures, the center of the physical world, eighty-four thousand leagues high, and was named for its heavy, powerful palm strikes, like Mount Sumeru itself. To execute it required a foundation of profound internal energy.

One had to first take a breath to store true energy, then unleash a flurry of palm strikes in a single, unbroken exhalation. As many palms as could be delivered in that one breath were delivered, each with the crushing force of Mount Tai and the fury of a raging sea, enough to be fatal. The deeper one's mastery, the more palms one could strike.

It was said that First Seat Juekong of the Universal Virtue Court, an expert in this art, could unleash twelve consecutive palms by using the Yijin Jing as his foundation. Liaojing had never learned the Yijin Jing, but his natural talent was exceptional and his foundation solid, allowing him to strike six palms, an astonishing feat among the younger generation.

After his first palm, the second followed immediately. Ming Buxiang, knowing its power, dodged to the side. The palm force struck the blade-grass nearby, shearing it in half at the stem and sending a patch of it to the ground amidst a flurry of flying leaves. It must be understood that blade-grass is soft and difficult to exert force upon; that this palm strike could sever it showed just how precise and formidable the control of power was.

Liaojing turned and struck with another palm. By now, Ming Buxiang appeared distressed as he dodged. Seeing that the fourth palm was unavoidable, he had no choice but to cross his arms before his chest in a hard block while simultaneously leaping backward.

The palm struck Ming Buxiang's arms with a loud crack. Although Ming Buxiang had used the momentum of his backward leap to dissipate some of the force, he was still sent flying. Liaojing judged that this blow was enough to injure Ming Buxiang's arms. Allowing the fiend no time to recover, he lunged forward like an ape and aimed his fifth palm at Ming Buxiang's chest.

Ming Buxiang happened to retreat right next to the corpse. Seeing that this palm was inescapable, he suddenly flicked his toe, sending the body on the ground flying up. Liaojing's palm landed squarely on this body with another loud smack, and the "corpse" let out a sharp, miserable cry.

'This person isn't dead?' Liaojing's mind reeled. Only then did he realize he had fallen into Ming Buxiang's trap. The true energy he had been holding in was instantly released, and he could no longer push out the sixth palm.

At the same time, he heard that extremely faint whistling of wind again.

'The Flower-Plucking Finger Art!'

Liaojing arched his upper body backward in an Iron Bridge maneuver, feeling a fierce gust of wind whistle past his face. Only then did he hear a heavy thud. It was the sound of Yuan Zhixuan's husband's body hitting the ground.

At this moment, he had no time to worry about whether the man was dead or alive. He channeled his true energy, and the sleeves of his robe inflated as if filled with air. As he straightened his waist, his arms continuously waved in circles, rushing forward as if he were protecting his front with two rotating balls. This was a move from the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art he had learned: _Great Thousand Treasure Wheel._

Ming Buxiang formed a circle with his left thumb and middle finger, and with a flick, he sent out a stream of formless energy. The formless finger energy struck Liaojing's sleeve. The sleeve first caved inward, then was repelled by the surging true energy within, causing the finger force to dissipate and scatter. The remaining energy only managed to shred the surrounding blade-grass.

Ming Buxiang flicked out four streams of finger energy in succession, all of which were blocked by the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art.

By now, Liaojing had closed the distance to Ming Buxiang, his sleeves fluttering with wide, sweeping motions, as if attacking Ming Buxiang with two large balls. This was the second move of the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art he had learned: _Rampage of Fiends._

Ming Buxiang had no time to launch another finger attack and could only dodge and evade. After a few moves, Liaojing found an opening and his sleeve swept across Ming Buxiang's chest. The blow sent Ming Buxiang flying with a wretched cry of "Wah!"

Liaojing felt the ribs in Ming Buxiang's chest fracture.

'I can win!' Liaojing thought. 'I absolutely cannot show mercy!'

Ming Buxiang was thrown a good ten feet away, and Liaojing pressed his advantage. He looked at the fallen Ming Buxiang, about to deliver the killing blow, when he suddenly saw the corners of Ming Buxiang's blood-streaked mouth lift into a faint smile.

'He's smiling?'

Liaojing didn't overthink it. He clasped his hands together into a hammer, his sleeves swelling with energy, and brought them down like a giant iron mallet toward Ming Buxiang's head. At that moment, with his sleeves filled with true energy, the impact would be no different from that of a great iron hammer.

Suddenly, a voice from behind roared, "Cease this violence!"

Liaojing did not stop. He knew the newcomer must be a Shaolin monk, but at this moment, he could not stop. Ming Buxiang was right; he had to be resolute. Even if it meant being expelled from Shaolin, even if it meant being hunted for a thousand li, he could not stop here.

In that hair's breadth of a moment, Ming Buxiang's body suddenly slid backward, narrowly avoiding the fatal blow. Liaojing's sleeves struck the ground, sending dust and smoke flying and blasting a large crater in the earth.

He heard the sound of rushing wind behind him as someone charged forward; from the sound, their martial arts were not particularly high. Almost simultaneously, he saw the still-seated Ming Buxiang curl his index and middle fingers into a circle—the fiend was about to counterattack!

'So close, just a little bit more!'

Once he lost the initiative, this monster might escape! Now caught between two enemies, Liaojing remained calm. He extended his arms horizontally, dipped his right shoulder, and raised his left arm diagonally, spinning in place like a female opera singer flicking her water sleeves.

This move was both defensive and offensive, designed to force back the person behind him while protecting his upper body from Ming Buxiang's Flower-Plucking Finger energy. Given the skill of the person behind him, they would surely dodge this thunderous attack, allowing him to use the momentum of the spin to strike Ming Buxiang again.

However, things did not go as planned. The attacker from behind seemed to have a death wish, leaning forward and meeting Liaojing's true-energy-infused sleeve with his head and face. With a sickening crack, the man cried out in agony, his skull fracturing as he fell backward.

Liaojing was stunned. He never expected the man not only to forgo dodging but to actually charge headfirst into his attack. How could ordinary flesh and blood withstand such a blow? It was certain death. A closer look revealed that it was Liaowu. And a short distance away, looking on with astonishment, were Liaowu's disciples and the Abbot of the Hall of True Vocation from the Universal Virtue Court, Jueji, also known by the moniker "Brocade Lion."

It turned out that Ming Buxiang's Flower-Plucking Finger had not been aimed at Liaojing, but at the Huantiao acupoint on Liaowu's hip behind him. Liaowu had been rushing forward so quickly that he only felt his knee suddenly give way, causing him to stumble and fall directly into Liaojing's sleeve, which was brimming with the true energy of the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art. At that moment, Ming Buxiang's figure was perfectly blocked by Liaojing and Liaowu, so even Jueji hadn't seen him make a move.

Jueji's brows shot up in anger as he muttered, "So it was you, it was you..."

"It wasn't me, it was..." Liaojing said in a panic. He turned his head and saw that Ming Buxiang had already risen gracefully to his feet and was standing in the distance. His handsome face was devoid of expression, merely watching him silently, like a bystander, or rather, a witness.

Jueji noticed another body on the ground and asked in a grim tone, "And who is this?"

Despite Liaojing's intelligence and quick wit, at this moment he was at a loss for words.

Jueji looked toward Ming Buxiang, who shook his head and said, "This disciple does not know either."

"You lie!" Liaojing raged. "You brought him here! He's Miss Yuan's husband!"

Jueji said, "When Liaowu told me, I still had my doubts. Bensong seduced a married woman, and you intervened to stop Liaowu from capturing the traitor. As if that wasn't enough, you had to kill to silence witnesses. If Ming Buxiang hadn't seen through your scheme and notified Liaowu in advance, you might have actually succeeded. You orthodox monks, every last one of you is a hypocrite."

After speaking, Jueji pressed his palms together. Strangely, he did so with great force, yet there was no sound when his palms met. Liaojing only felt an incomparably sharp palm force rushing toward him and knew it was the Amitabha Palm, one of the upper-hall martial arts.

The uniqueness of this palm strike was that the force was not projected forward, but squeezed out at the moment the hands were brought together, just like the gesture of an ordinary monk chanting "Amitabha Buddha." Hence its name, the Amitabha Palm.

Seeing his opponent attack, Liaojing quickly activated his Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art and swung his sleeve to block. With a ripping sound, his sleeve disintegrated into tatters. Liaojing felt as if he had been struck by a heavy blow to the chest and was forced back several steps.

All abbots of the Four Courts and Eight Halls and above cultivated the Yijin Jing. Jueji was also much older and more experienced than Liaojing, so he was quite surprised that this palm strike had failed to subdue him. But his fleeting thought of cherishing talent lasted only a moment before he brought his palms together again.

Having suffered a setback, Liaojing knew he couldn't face it head-on and could only leap away to dodge. Jueji anticipated his move, and his third palm strike went straight for where he would land. Seeing no way to evade, Liaojing knew that taking the blow would result in serious injury, but he had no choice but to meet the attack.

Suddenly, a figure rushed in from the side, shouting, "Spare him!" and threw out a palm strike that nullified the force of the Amitabha Palm.

That voice was the one Liaojing knew best; it belonged to his master, Jueru.

Jueru was heard scolding, "You wretched boy, what are you doing sneaking out in the middle of the night instead of sleeping?"

Then he turned to Jueji with a hearty laugh, "Abbot Jueji, what has my disciple done to warrant you bringing out the Amitabha Palm to teach him a lesson?"

Jueji said coldly, "This fine disciple of yours colluded with Bensong. First, he saved him yesterday, and today he killed a witness to silence him. The man lying there is the husband of the woman Bensong seduced. Liaowu also died by his hand. The evidence is irrefutable."

Jueru's heart sank. He first looked at Liaowu's body; Liaowu's face was covered in blood, his skull fractured and his features caved in as if he had been hit by a large iron ball. He recognized it as the work of the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art. He then bent down to examine the nameless corpse; its sternum was shattered, and the palm print was much larger than a normal hand, a characteristic of the Great Sumeru Palm. 

He rubbed his chin, stood up, and said, "It does seem to be the case. But it's so late, how did Abbot Jueji know to come here to find my disciple?"

Jueji pointed at Ming Buxiang behind Jueru and said, "He sought out Liaowu tonight and told him that he saw Liaojing following Bensong out of the Buddha Capital yesterday, but didn't know where they went. Liaowu remembered that the masked monk who rescued the Bensong yesterday used the Left and Right Flower-Weaving Palm, a specialty of your disciple. So he kept him under surveillance, saw him leave the temple, and came to inform me. Who would have thought that as soon as I arrived, I would witness him committing murder. Liaowu tried to stop him but was killed by a sweep of his sleeve."

What Jueji didn't say was that Liaowu, upon seeing Liaojing fighting with Ming Buxiang, had disregarded his orders and tried to launch a sneak attack on Liaojing, which resulted in him being beaten to death.

Liaojing felt as if he had been plunged into an icy cellar. Only now did he understand that everything had been orchestrated by Ming Buxiang. He was indeed the one who had killed Yuan Zhixuan's husband, and he was indeed the one who had killed Liaowu. This fiend... this fiend...

He glared at Ming Buxiang with hatred, but Ming Buxiang showed no reaction at all, his eyes clear, as if he were completely innocent.

Jueji asked, "And why are you here? Could it be that you were also aware of what your disciple was doing?"

"This boy has been especially attentive lately. Yesterday afternoon, he even came to ask after my well-being, telling me to take care of myself. I thought something was strange and wanted to ask him about it, but he wasn't in his room. It was past midnight and he still hadn't returned, so I came out to look for him," Jueru explained, then turned to Ming Buxiang and asked, "And how did you end up here?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "I couldn't sleep, so I came here for a walk and saw Martial Uncle Liaojing with the body on the ground. Martial Uncle Liaojing then attacked me."

Jueru laughed heartily. "A four-li walk just for a stroll, and you still have to walk back. You truly have a leisurely spirit. Abbot Jueming praised your intelligence, and it seems he was right. Even my disciple is no match for you." Then he turned to scold Liaojing, "I told you to properly learn your martial arts, but you wouldn't listen. Look, you can't even do a proper job of silencing a witness! Now you've been caught red-handed, what are you going to do?"

Liaojing was speechless. At this moment, he couldn't argue his way out of it. Even if he told the truth, such an outlandish story, with no evidence, who would believe him? It would only invite ridicule. But even so, Liaojing thought, if he were captured and taken back to Shaolin, death would be certain. Escape was also impossible. Rather than await his fate, he had to speak the truth, no matter how unbelievable, if only to warn his master not to fall for this fiend's tricks.

Just as he was about to speak, Jueru walked over to Jueji, put his left arm around Jueji's shoulder, and said with a grin, "Senior Brother, how about we make a deal?"

Jueji said coldly, "It has come to this, and you still want to shield your disciple?"

Jueru scratched his head. "Alas, wasn't the matter with Ban Gou also suppressed by First Seat Juekong? Let's just call it an accidental killing. We can lock him up for a few decades and have him chant sutras as punishment, how about that?"

Jueji said coldly, "That will be for the Hall of Upright Action to decide."

Jueru laughed heartily. "The Hall of Upright Action? Easy enough, easy enough!"

As he spoke, his left hand, which was draped over Jueji's shoulder, suddenly tightened. His right hand shot out, and with a Dragon's Claw move, he seized Jueji by the throat.

He turned his head and yelled at Liaojing, "What are you waiting for? Run! Do you want to die here?"

The sudden turn of events left Liaojing stunned. Hearing his master's shout, he finally came to his senses and turned to flee.

He dashed in Ming Buxiang's direction, and as they passed each other, Ming Buxiang did not try to stop him. In that fleeting moment, their eyes met.

Their gazes locked, one burning with fury, the other as cold as ice.

Jueji had not expected Jueru to so blatantly protect his disciple and roared, "Jueru, what are you doing?!"

Jueru said, "What am I doing? Saving my disciple, of course. Did you think I was here to practice with you?"

Jueji shouted angrily, "What are you all standing there for? Go after him!"

The few Proctor Monks Liaowu had brought with him were about to give chase when they heard Jueru laugh heartily again, "You won't be able to beat him even if you catch up, so why bother chasing? He even killed Liaowu; there's no guarantee he won't kill you too!"

These words proved effective; the Proctor Monks immediately halted.

As Jueji was about to channel his energy to break free from Jueru's hold, Jueru said, "Don't struggle. I've already gone this far, which means I'll risk my own life to protect my disciple. If you struggle and I'm forced to kill you, won't that be another life lost? For one Bensong who seduced a woman, Shaolin Temple loses two abbots at once. It's not worth it."

Though he spoke in jest, Jueji knew he was telling the truth, so he asked, "How do you plan to resolve this?"

"Just like this," Jueru said, releasing his grip and looking at Jueji. "I'll go back to the temple with you. I'll take full responsibility for everything."

Jueji said coldly, "I'm afraid you won't be able to bear it."

Jueru laughed loudly and said, "We shall see." He glanced at Ming Buxiang and asked, "Are you injured?"

Ming Buxiang clutched his chest and said, "My chest was struck by Martial Uncle, but it's not life-threatening."

Jueru smiled. "Have the medicine monk take a look when you get back to the temple. If you were seriously injured, Juejian would have my head."

Ming Buxiang pressed his palms together in a respectful gesture. Before leaving, he looked again in the direction Liaojing had fled, a thoughtful expression on his face.

Liaojing ran desperately, only slowing his pace after covering ten li. In this confrontation with Ming Buxiang, he had been utterly defeated. His mind had been in turmoil as he fled, with no time to think clearly. Now, thinking of his master, tears welled up in his eyes.

He thought, 'Master has violated the precepts to protect me. Did he manage to escape too?'

He looked back and saw no one pursuing him.

'Master didn't follow? Is he going back to Shaolin Temple?'

On second thought, Jueji was the abbot of the Hall of True Vocation and the right-hand man of First Seat Juekong, the foremost of the secular monks. In terms of martial arts alone, his master might not have the upper hand. Jueru had gained the advantage through a sneak attack; if he really wanted to escape, he would have had to injure Jueji.

He was a meticulous person, and now that he had calmed down, he thought further: 'If Master really did injure Jueji, wouldn't his crime be even greater? If Master didn't escape, what kind of punishment will he face when he returns to the temple? No, I can't let my master be harmed because of me.'

At this thought, he turned to head back toward Shaolin Temple. But after a few steps, he thought again: 'If I go back, I will surely die, and no one will ever be able to expose Ming Buxiang's deeds. Even if Master believes me, he might not be able to do anything about Ming Buxiang.'

He also considered that since Ming Buxiang had led people to the scene beforehand, he probably hadn't been fighting with his full strength in their initial exchange. When he fled, Ming Buxiang hadn't tried to stop him. Why? Was it because he knew he couldn't, or did he have another plan?

His master had always been resourceful. Perhaps he had a way to get through this ordeal. If he rushed back now, he would just be walking to his death. It would be better to hide outside the temple for a few days, gather information, and then decide what to do based on the situation.

Having made his decision, Liaojing immediately found a secluded place to hide and tend to his injuries.

※ ※ ※

The affair concerning Liaojing caused a great stir within Shaolin Temple. Bensong had seduced a young married woman, Liaojing had killed to silence a witness, and Jueru had shielded him out of favoritism; three orthodox monks of different generations had all violated the precepts.

Bensong and Liaojing's crimes were certainly capital offenses, and Jueru's act of holding Jueji hostage was an added crime, making a death sentence a distinct possibility. It had been over thirty years since an abbot of the Four Courts or Eight Halls had committed a capital crime, and at that time, it had been a secular monk. For an orthodox monk who was an abbot to be sentenced to death was truly unprecedented.

Jueru was imprisoned and confessed to all his crimes without reservation. Given his high seniority and position, even if convicted, his punishment would require the joint deliberation of the Four Courts.

Juejian questioned Ming Buxiang about the events of that day. Ming Buxiang only said that he had gone out for a walk, encountered Liaojing, and had just started to fight when Abbot Jueji arrived. Juejian frowned, merely shaking his head and sighing endlessly as he sent men to search for and arrest Bensong and Liaojing.

The orthodox monks had given the secular monks such a huge scandal to hold over them. Not only was it a great loss of face, but their morale was also deeply affected. Some said Bensong had been corrupted by the secular monks, while others claimed the woman had been sent by the secular monks to seduce him. In response, the secular monks naturally reveled in mockery.

The Observing Sufferings Court, where Jueru belonged, was originally established to handle the temple's administrative affairs, and its monks were equally divided between orthodox and secular.

Although Juewen, the abbot of the Hall of True Mindfulness, was a secular monk, he was mature and prudent, a serious practitioner who had only fallen into the secular faction because he had chosen the wrong master in his youth. In contrast, Jueru was often joking and laughing, occasionally making off-color remarks, and seemed more like a secular monk.

It was common knowledge that Jueru and Juewen did not get along, but few knew that their discord was not due to the orthodox-secular divide, but because of their diametrically opposed personalities. Juewen considered Jueru flippant and dissolute, while Jueru found Juewen rigid and dull.

With Jueru's imprisonment, Juewen immediately ordered his disciples to refrain from provoking the orthodox monks. However, not everyone in the Observing Sufferings Court was a disciple of Juewen. Moreover, the matter of changing the secular monks' names had already aroused public anger, and the original proponents of this idea were First Seat Jueguan and Abbot Jueru.

And so, it happened like this. During the evening meal, the orthodox and secular monks of the Observing Sufferings Court sat separately, with a row of tables between them, clearly divided.

Jueru's seventh disciple, Liaojing's senior disciple brother Liaocheng, was busy with official duties and worried about his master, so he was late for the meal. By the time he arrived, everyone was already seated. Liaocheng saw that there were no seats left on the orthodox monks' side, with only the middle row, neither orthodox nor secular, still empty.

Not wanting to attract attention, he turned to leave, but suddenly heard someone say, "Senior Brother Liaocheng, don't go, there's a seat here."

He turned back to see a monk from the secular side stand up and say, "Senior Brother Liaocheng, come over here, there's a spot."

Originally, there were no designated orthodox or secular seats in the dining hall; the current clear division was voluntary. Hearing this, Liaocheng was taken aback. He was an orthodox monk; how could he go and sit on the secular monks' side?

That person then continued, "Your junior disciple brother has already become a pimp, so what are you still doing sitting over there? Hurry, hurry, this is your place."

Liaocheng knew this was a provocation and was furious, but he chose to ignore it.

Then he heard another person say, "What's the benefit of matchmaking for others? Is it a lack of money? You can't squeeze any oil out of Bensong, so what's the gain?"

The first person spoke again, "Who knows? According to Liaowu's disciples, that woman is quite beautiful. Maybe... there really is a benefit."

After he finished, everyone burst into laughter.

Liaocheng turned to leave, but someone else said, "Don't be in such a hurry to go. Are you busy playing matchmaker? If there are any benefits, remember to look out for your disciple brothers."

Liaocheng just ignored him. As he reached the doorway, he heard another person say, "If his junior disciple brother is a pimp, what does that make his master?"

Another replied, "The head of the pimps, of course, that's called..." The person deliberately trailed off, but everyone knew what he meant.

With a series of loud crashes, tables and chairs went flying. Liaocheng had flipped a table, sending it crashing down on the person who had spoken. He could tolerate insults to himself, he could tolerate insults to his junior disciple brother, but no one could insult his master!

The man was hit by the table and chairs, cried out "Ai!" and fell to the ground.

His companions immediately rose and rushed toward Liaocheng. The orthodox monks on the other side had long been holding back their anger. They had refrained from retorting out of concern for karmic misdeeds of speech, but now, seeing the others swarm forward, they too rushed up to defend Liaocheng.

In an instant, the dining hall erupted into chaos as hundreds of orthodox and secular monks fought in a tangled mass. The animosity between the two sides had been brewing for a long time. At first, they were mindful of their fraternal bonds and the temple's rules, but as tempers flared, their blows became heavier.

Tables and chairs were broken, and bowls and plates were shattered. A secular monk was kicked, crashed into the corner of a table, and instantly collapsed in a pool of blood, unconscious.

Seeing this, his companion cried out in grief and anger, "Murder! The orthodox monks are killing people!"

With that, he picked up a shard of porcelain, lunged forward, and plunged it into the neck of the orthodox monk who had delivered the kick. The monk clutched the wound on his neck, but could not stop the blood that gushed out like a spring. He staggered back a few steps, swayed, and fell.

Someone had already notified Jueguan and Juewen, who rushed over to find the dining hall in utter turmoil. Jueguan channeled his internal energy and shouted, "Stop!"

This shout, amplified by his internal energy, carried far. Despite the noise, it was heard clearly. The crowd, realizing that a first seat and an abbot had arrived, was startled and stopped fighting.

A few brawlers continued, but Jueguan rushed into their midst, separating them with punches and kicks. Both sides glared at each other, baring their teeth. As they helped up their injured and fallen disciples, they discovered a body in the middle of the dining hall, a porcelain shard stuck in its neck, lying silently in a pool of blood.

The sound of shuffling footsteps was heard outside the dining hall. It was Abbot Juejian, leading the Proctor Monks from the Hall of Upright Action, arriving to quell the disturbance.

The news of orthodox and secular monks brawling and killing each other spread quickly through Shaolin Temple. Ming Buxiang also heard the news, but he still showed no reaction.

He simply returned to his room, prostrated himself before the statue of Buddha, knelt on the ground, and kowtowed three times before beginning to chant the sutras. His lowered eyelids and long lashes were as beautiful as a jade carving, giving him an air of solemnity.

In the room, only the sound of chanting lingered.

Liaojing hid in the wilderness outside the Buddha Capital for several days. The Proctor Monks dispatched by the temple were searching meticulously, and he narrowly avoided discovery several times thanks to his quick wits. But he was worried about his master's safety and was desperate to get news from within the temple.

One day, he saw a woodcutter enter the mountains to chop wood. Seeing no one else around, he stopped him and asked, "Excuse me, benefactor, are you a resident of the area near the Buddha Capital?"

The woodcutter looked him up and down, nodded, and asked, "Is the master a monk from Shaolin?"

Liaojing replied, "Yes, I am. I have just returned from official business. I was wondering... has anything major happened at the temple recently?"

The woodcutter looked at him and suddenly said, "You are Master Liaojing, aren't you?"

Liaojing's heart jumped, and he quickly said, "Why would the benefactor think that? My Dharma name is Liaocheng. Liaojing is my junior disciple brother."

The woodcutter said, "Come with me. Someone wants to see you."

After speaking, the woodcutter turned and walked away. Liaojing hesitated, but the woodcutter turned back and said, "Don't worry, I won't harm you."

Liaojing thought for a moment and followed.

The woodcutter led Liaojing down a deserted path, twisting and turning. Liaojing observed his surroundings along the way but saw no one else. The two of them walked until they reached a small wooden cabin.

"Wait here. Someone will come to see you."

"Who?"

The woodcutter simply did not answer and left on his own.

Liaojing pushed open the door and saw that the cabin was simply furnished with an armchair, a small tea table, and seven or eight stools. On a cabinet to the side were a few jars of tea leaves and a tea set. There were no other rooms.

He waited for a long time, but no one came. He grew anxious and suspicious, fearing it was a trap. He went outside to check several times but saw no sign of the pursuing Proctor Monks. He also surveyed the environment, planning his escape route in case the worst should happen.

Then he thought, perhaps there was no need to escape. What did it matter if he confessed and was captured? In the end, his master was suffering for his sake. How could he just walk away?

He waited from the afternoon until dusk, and from dusk until night. At midnight, he looked out the window and saw a tall, straight figure dressed in a yellow kasaya striding closer under the moonlight. He recognized it as the attire of an abbot of the Eight Halls or higher. His heart leaped in alarm. He quickly opened the door, and only then did he get a clear look at the person.

The man's chiseled face held a pair of eyes that were imposing without being angry. It was the First Seat of the Universal Virtue Court, Juekong.

Seeing him open the door, Juekong nodded in acknowledgment and strode into the cabin. Liaojing knew that escape was now impossible, so he simply followed him in.

Juekong sat in the host's seat. Liaojing bowed respectfully and said, "Disciple Liaojing pays his respects to First Seat Juekong."

"Sit," Juekong said. It was a single word, yet it carried an authority that seemed to emanate from his very bones.

It was an authority built from age and experience, from status and position, an iron will forged through countless trials. It was like a mountain, withstanding excavation and weathering, which only left their marks but could not shake it in the slightest.

Compared to him, the other abbots and first seats of the Four Courts and Eight Halls seemed like officials merely carrying out orders. They might be capable, but they were not the ones with a view of the entire board. Not even Abbot Juesheng was.

Liaojing sat down. He was normally a relaxed and lazy person, and would usually sit hunched over for comfort, but seeing Juekong's perfectly straight posture, he couldn't help but sit up straight as well.

Juekong said, "This humble monk does not have much time, so I will be brief. If you go back, you will surely die."

"This disciple knows," Liaojing replied. He felt a sense of reverence for this leader of the secular monks, and his tone became serious. "But this disciple cannot let his master take the blame."

Juekong said, "The blame has already been taken. If you go back, he will still be punished, and your life will just be another one lost. His initial sacrifice will have been in vain. Your master would not want that for you."

Liaojing said urgently, "This disciple was framed."

Juekong retorted, "Framed how?"

Liaojing recounted the entire affair with Ming Buxiang, from noticing the *Flower-Plucking Finger Art* manual had been read, to finding the incriminating evidence under his bed. He then handed the journal to Juekong.

"He was the one who killed Bu Gui and Lü Changfeng, forced Fu Yingcong to his death, and drove Benyue mad. Bensong's seduction of the woman is also connected to him," Liaojing said. "I suspect he is also the one who instigated the conflict between the orthodox and secular factions within the temple."

Juekong asked, "Is this Ming Buxiang's handwriting?"

Liaojing was taken aback. "This is my handwriting. He imitated my handwriting to frame me."

"Do you have proof?"

Liaojing shook his head. "No."

Juekong handed the journal back to Liaojing without another word. Liaojing understood what Juekong meant. Everything he knew was based on speculation and Ming Buxiang's confession, but the handwriting in that confession was his own. There was no concrete evidence. He couldn't help but sigh.

Juekong said, "It is impossible to save yourself and your master with just this. You are a talented individual; it would be a waste for you to die here. Leave at once."

He had said he would be brief, and he truly was. His tone was not one of negotiation, but of command. After speaking, he stood up. Liaojing quickly stood up as well and asked, "What about my master?"

Juekong said, "I will do my best to ensure he does not die."

A great weight was lifted from Liaojing's heart. Juekong was the leader of the secular monks; as long as he gave his word, the secular monks would not press the matter, and the Abbot would likely grant a lighter sentence.

He said to Juekong, "Even if the First Seat does not believe my words, I implore you to pay close attention to this person, Ming Buxiang."

"I know," Juekong said, raising a hand to stop him from continuing. "This humble monk will be watchful."

With that, Juekong strode away without a backward glance.

Liaojing breathed a sigh of relief and left the cabin. As he walked, he thought, and suddenly understood. Juekong had anticipated that he would be worried about his master and wouldn't go far, yet would never ask the monks directly, so he had sent someone disguised as a woodcutter to draw him out. In this way, the First Seat of the Universal Virtue Court was indeed a meticulous thinker.

A moment later, another thought struck him with a jolt.

'This cabin must be a secret meeting place for the secular monks. The woodcutter is very familiar with the Buddha Capital's surroundings, so he must be a resident. To find me, he must have sent out more than just this one scout. How many of Juekong's men are there hidden in the Buddha Capital? And why has he placed so many subordinates here?'

He looked back in the direction of the cabin, a shiver running down his spine.

Regardless, he had already told Juekong about Ming Buxiang. A man as shrewd and capable as Juekong should be able to keep that fiend in check.

He thought of Ming Buxiang. To this day, he still found him completely unfathomable.

But what Liaojing didn't know was that Juekong had not taken his words seriously. To Juekong, Ming Buxiang was just an excuse Liaojing had concocted, stringing together recent events in the temple in a desperate attempt to absolve himself.

This disciple was indeed clever, to be able to connect so many incidents, but the plot was simply too bizarre. Putting everything else aside, how could a fifteen-year-old boy possibly incite a conflict between the orthodox and secular factions?

The one who had incited the conflict was not Ming Buxiang, but the archaic rules of Shaolin Temple. Its roots had been planted long before Ming Buxiang was born—fifty years ago, even ninety years ago, and long, long before that.

As the leader of the secular monks, the de facto second-in-command of Shaolin Temple, Juekong's ambition had never wavered. It had been established fifty years ago, after the end of the Shao-Song Conflict, when he, still a young boy, became a disciple under one of the first five secular monks.

"Jueru's crimes are grave, and the public anger is difficult to appease. Nothing short of the ultimate punishment will suffice."

In the assembly hall of the Abbot's Court, Juekong stood with his back ramrod straight. At all times, he exuded an intimidating presence.

Abbot Juesheng said, "Shielding a disciple is not a crime punishable by death."

Juekong said, "But holding an abbot hostage, is that not punishable by death?"

Juekong's cold eyes swept across the room.

The brawl in the dining hall was only the beginning. The conflict between the orthodox and secular factions was like a taut string, ready to snap at any moment.

Jueru and Jueguan were the proponents of changing the secular monks' names. If Jueru did not die, the anger of the secular monks would be difficult to pacify. Conversely, after Jueru's death, the matter of the name change could be revisited, or at the very least, shelved for the time being.

As for Liaojing, if he returned to accept his punishment, Jueru's crime would no longer be punishable by death. Given the deep bond between master and disciple, Jueru would surely blame the secular monks, and the proposal to change their names would become even more unshakeable.

A dead silence filled the assembly hall of the Abbot's Court, broken only by a long sigh from Abbot Juesheng.

"First Seat Juekong will not spare your master," Ming Buxiang said faintly.

Liaojing had not expected to run into Ming Buxiang.

It was on a small path leading away from Mount Shaoshi. He had been extremely careful when leaving the wooden cabin, certain that no one was following him. It was impossible for Ming Buxiang to have overheard his conversation with Juekong.

"I guessed you hadn't left yet. I've been looking for you these past few days. I'm glad I found you."

Liaojing became vigilant.

"What do you mean by that?" Liaojing asked.

"First Seat Juekong does not want to trigger a full-blown conflict between the orthodox and secular factions. Only by your master's death can the secular monks' anger be quelled," Ming Buxiang said, shaking his head. "He will not spare your master."

Liaojing turned to leave. He had to go back to Mount Shaoshi to save his master.

"If you go back, your master won't die, but many more people will."

Liaojing turned back and sneered, "Isn't that your goal?"

"Why would I want to kill them?" Ming Buxiang said. "What good would that do me?"

"How should I know!" Liaojing said angrily. "What do you really want?!"

"Right now?" Ming Buxiang thought for a moment, as if carefully choosing his words for precision. Finally, he said, "You were the first person to 'see' me. So, I want to help you."

As he said this, Ming Buxiang was not smiling, but simply looking intently at Liaojing.

Fury and ice clashed once more.
