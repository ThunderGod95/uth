# Chapter 2: Buddha's Hand, Spider's Silk

Kunlun Year 80, Summer, the fifth month.

Ming Buxiang did not move out of his residence in the Hall of Upright Action; he simply rose earlier than usual to make his way to the Hall of True Insight in the Unique Wisdom Court.

The Unique Wisdom Court was divided into two halls: True Insight and True Concentration. The Hall of True Insight managed the library of classics and focused on the study of Buddhist doctrine and martial arts, while the Hall of True Concentration was responsible for teaching and instruction, its Hall Monks consisting mostly of lecturing sutra monks or instructing martial monks. If disciples in the monastery wished to advance their martial studies, they often needed to study at the Hall of True Concentration. The Hall of True Concentration also held classes from time to time, which might involve lecturing on sutras, demonstrating martial techniques, or traveling to test the disciples.

Buddhism placed the highest importance on classic texts and sutras. Though the four courts were said to be equal, it was an unspoken rule that Unique Wisdom ranked first, Universal Virtue second, and Earth Treasury last. Within the Unique Wisdom Court, only a handful of secular monks were ever permitted to enter its halls, and the positions of first seat and the abbots of the two halls had not been held by a secular monk for decades.

"This humble monk is Benyan, your work detail leader." The monk at the head of the group was tall and well-built, with two downturned eyebrows that gave him a perpetually worried look, earning him the nickname _Senior Brother Sorrow_ from the others.

Senior Brother Sorrow asked Ming Buxiang, "What were your duties in the Hall of Upright Action?"

"Carrying night soil," Ming Buxiang said. "For one year."

"That Spotted Dog is nothing but a bully, hmph!" Senior Brother Sorrow pouted, his worried expression deepening.

"We take turns emptying the night soil here; no one gets out of it." He continued, "The Unique Wisdom Court used to be called the scripture repository, a place for preserving classic texts and advancing martial studies. It was later reorganized into the Unique Wisdom Court with the addition of the Hall of True Concentration to preach the Dao, impart knowledge, and resolve the doubts of Buddhist disciples. Even with the reorganization, the scripture repository still remains. The Hall of True Insight is different from the Hall of Upright Action; there are few people and large halls, with most rooms used for storing texts. Since the masters spend their years engrossed in scholarship, we have more chores to handle, including sweeping, emptying the night soil, carrying water, and chopping firewood. You're young, so I'll assign your tasks accordingly."

Ming Buxiang said, "This junior brother can be assigned the same duties as the others."

"I'll be the judge of that," Senior Brother Sorrow said. "Go sweep the scripture repository."

The layout of the Unique Wisdom Court was roughly the same as that of the Universal Virtue Court, consisting mostly of monks' quarters. The Hall of True Insight was a sprawling complex with five successive courtyards, its central courtyard serving as a training ground for martial arts demonstrations and sutra lectures. The scripture repository was situated centrally behind the Hall of True Insight; though simple and unadorned, it was a grand and imposing structure.

Stepping into this hallowed ground of Shaolin for the first time, Ming Buxiang felt a sense of solemn dignity. The soft echo of his light footsteps in the great hall made it seem as though even a slightly hurried pace would be an act of desecration.

Upon entering the great hall, he walked to the left and pushed open a large copper door, revealing rows upon rows of tightly packed bookshelves. Ming Buxiang saw that they held mostly collections of literature and history, along with various practical miscellanies, all sorted by category. This section was called the "Repository of Natural History."

Deeper inside, past a small wooden door, lay another, smaller hall. This was the "Prajna Repository," which housed various annotated and translated versions of Buddhist scriptures, as well as original texts. Some of the books were so ancient and mottled with age that they were difficult to read.

Ming Buxiang took a copy of the _Samyukta Agama Sutra_ from a shelf and was about to flip through it when someone behind him spoke.

"If you want to read that, you have to borrow it from a cataloging monk. It's time for sweeping now, don't slack off."

Ming Buxiang turned to see a handsome young man in his early twenties who had not shaved his head, indicating he was also a lay disciple, smiling at him.

The young man pointed to the far end of the hall. "There's one more room over there. You can go sweep it."

Ming Buxiang nodded and walked over, where he saw that the entrance was a small, cast-iron door. Though small, the door was a full three inches thick; if it were solid steel, someone with lesser strength would likely be unable to move it at all.

The iron door was half-open. As Ming Buxiang drew near, the other disciples who were sweeping suddenly stopped what they were doing and stared at him. Seemingly oblivious, Ming Buxiang was about to push the door when a dark figure rushed out, shouting, and gave him a hard shove in the chest. The force was so great that it sent him flying, yet Ming Buxiang managed to stabilize himself in mid-air and land solidly on his feet, not even stumbling.

He heard loud laughter from the others behind him, and someone even cheered, "Incredible!"

Ming Buxiang looked again at the person who had pushed him: a man with a crooked mouth and slanted nose, his features all twisted together. He was about six feet tall, with a stooped figure and a very conspicuous hump on his back.

The man waved his hands frantically, shouting, "You can't come in here! Get out! Get out!"

His tone was urgent and angry. After speaking, he shot another glance at Ming Buxiang, his pupils contracting and the corners of his mouth twitching slightly, before he quickly ducked back inside as if afraid of being looked at any longer.

Ming Buxiang noticed all of this.

"It was just a joke, don't be angry." The handsome young man from earlier came over, laughing heartily. "Everyone here has been knocked down by Bu Gui. You could call it our initiation."

One of the disciples said in praise, "That was amazing, you didn't even fall. Senior Brother Lü took a tumble his first time, too."

The handsome young man clasped his hands in a salute. "My name is Lü Changfeng. Like you, I'm a lay disciple."

Ming Buxiang returned the salute. "I am Ming Buxiang."

Lü Changfeng asked, "Your stance is incredibly stable. Who is your master?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "Monk Liaoxin."

A murmur of surprise went through the surrounding disciples, who began to whisper among themselves. Lü Changfeng turned and said, "Everyone, back to work." The disciples scattered, returning to their tasks.

Lü Changfeng asked, "Do you know where your master went?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head.

"I thought so. Alas," Lü Changfeng said. "Don't mind what just happened. The senior brothers here are all good people."

"Who was that man?" Ming Buxiang asked, looking at the iron door. "Are we not allowed in there?"

Lü Changfeng said, "That is the Repository of Divine Arts, where the monastery's martial arts manuals are kept. No one is allowed inside without permission. That Bu Gui has a terrible temper. That's his area to clean, so don't provoke him unless you have to."

"To clean?" Ming Buxiang asked. "He's the same as us?"

"In theory, yes, but he's also a bit different." He thought for a moment, then explained, "The abbot allows him to freely enter and exit the Repository of Divine Arts, so he's solely responsible for cleaning that place. He drives away anyone who gets close. It's not that we shun him for his ugliness; it's just that he has a short temper and doesn't talk to anyone, so nobody wants to set him off."

Ming Buxiang nodded in understanding.

The labor disciples of the Hall of True Insight got along well, often joking and roughhousing with one another and frequently going on outings together, forming strong bonds. Lü Changfeng was a standout among them; his master was also a Hall Monk of the Hall of True Insight, making him the de facto leader of the group. As for Senior Brother Sorrow, he assigned duties fairly but had recently become distant, which everyone attributed to his diligent training for the upcoming martial trial to earn a Writ of Chivalry.

As for Bu Gui, he did not live in the monks' quarters within the court but in a storage room inside the scripture repository. Apart from his sweeping in the early morning, he was rarely seen.

The harmony of the Hall of True Insight did not seem to include Bu Gui. Just as Lü Changfeng had said, he was a bit different.

Bu Gui's birth name was Bu Li; his parents likely chose it in the hope that he could "stand upright." His crooked mouth, slanted nose, and hunched back were all congenital. It seemed a doctor had explained the reason, but he couldn't remember it clearly. His deepest memory of his parents was his father telling him, "Li'er, stand straight! Stand straight!" and the sound of his mother's weeping.

This memory was faint, so faint that Bu Gui himself wasn't sure if it was real.

His parents died when he was very young. He was a beggar from childhood; one could even say his memories began with begging on the streets. Every child who saw him laughed and cursed at him. He had stones thrown at him, and other parents would prevent their children from playing with him, as if his hunchback were contagious.

Others dared not approach him, and after being beaten and berated for so long, he no longer dared to approach others. He could only squat in corners, begging for scraps of food. Sometimes he caught wild rats, other times he netted fish from ponds, surviving from one meal to the next.

This continued until he was ten, when he met his master, a Hall Monk from the Hall of True Insight named Liaoyin.

Seeing his pitiable state, Monk Liaoyin brought him back to Shaolin Temple to care for him, and only then did he know warmth and a full stomach. To show his gratitude, he always worked with exceptional diligence. But Monk Liaoyin did not care for him for long. Less than two years later, the monk fell ill for no reason and passed away shortly after. Bu Gui cried bitterly, not only out of gratitude for Liaoyin's care, but also from fear that his good days were over.

Fortunately, the monks of the Hall of True Insight did not cast him out. These orthodox monks were compassionate and willing to take him in. There was just one thing, something Bu Gui himself didn't know: Liaoyin had originally transferred from the Observing Sufferings Court. Although he came from an orthodox monk background, he had been very close with the secular monks and often said, "Shaolin Temple relies on secular monks for many things. If we do not ask about their origins, why distinguish between orthodox and secular?"

For this, the monks of the Hall of True Insight could only shake their heads and sigh, lamenting that such a good monk as Liaoyin had stumbled and fallen, associating with the secular monks.

Since Liaoyin was considered to be close to the secular faction, Bu Gui's situation became awkward. The orthodox monks, wanting to avoid suspicion, dared not get close to him, while the secular monks saw him as a follower of an orthodox monk and paid him no mind. As a result, none of the temple monks were willing to look after him. Luckily, he was simple and diligent, so Abbot Jueming of the Hall of True Insight assigned him to sweep the Repository of Divine Arts, a place that normally required three people to clean properly, yet he managed to keep it spotless all by himself. Due to his unsightly appearance and reclusive nature, he was allowed to live in a storage room in the scripture repository, where he had remained for ten years.

Bu Gui saw his work in the Repository of Divine Arts as his sole value in Shaolin Temple. He was born with great strength and would drive away anyone who tried to approach.

He was terrified that if he lost this job, he would have to return to begging on the streets. He feared the streets, and he feared those people.

Bu Gui was not without aspirations. Every day after finishing his sweeping, he would return to his room, arch his back, and support himself with his hands on the ground, practicing the Iron Bridge. This was a technique he had begged Liaoyin to teach him. He stretched his back daily, enduring immense pain, practicing for a full hour, hoping only that his hunchback could become a little straighter. He did not ask to be like a normal person, only to be a little taller, a little straighter, even if just by a little.

This posture resembled a turtle flipped onto its back. Ironically, he only hoped this posture could make him less like a turtle. This was the reason he would rather live in a storage room than with the other disciples, a secret he would never let anyone discover.

"Long ago, there was a great robber named Kandata. He committed countless evils in his life, and after death, he fell into hell to suffer the torment of fire. One day, the Buddha was passing a well when he heard wretched cries. He looked down and saw that the well led straight to hell, where Kandata was being tormented by flames. When Kandata saw the Buddha, whose Dharma body was majestic, pure, and holy, he cried out, 'Buddha, save me!'"

On this day, Abbot Jueming, on a whim, summoned the disciples to test them on the _Precepts for Buddhist Disciples_ and to expound upon the Dharma. Bu Gui was also in attendance as Jueming told this story.

"Hearing Kandata's cry for help, the Buddha opened his Dharma eye and observed the three thousand worlds, past and future. It turned out that although Kandata had committed countless evils in his life, there was one time when he was walking and was about to step on a spider. A thought suddenly moved him, and he wondered why he should harm a living creature. So he took a step over it, sparing the spider. The Buddha then reached out his hand, took a spider, and placed it by the well. The spider spun a thread down into the well, and when Kandata saw his chance, he hurriedly grabbed it and began to climb. He climbed and climbed, and halfway up he grew tired and paused to catch his breath. Looking down, he saw all the other beings of hell climbing up the same spider's thread. He thought, 'This thread is so thin, how can it bear so much weight? If it breaks, won't I have to go back to hell and suffer?' So he kicked at the demons following behind him and cursed, 'This spider's thread is mine! You're not allowed to follow me up!' With that kick, the spider's thread instantly snapped. As Kandata fell back into hell, he heard only the Buddha's soft sigh."

Jueming said, "Do no evil, and practice all good. Do not fail to do a good deed because it is small, nor do an evil deed because it is small. You are all young and full of vigor; you must be especially mindful. The _Precepts for Buddhist Disciples_ is your good teacher, and you must remember it well."

Bu Gui sat in a corner, listening with rapt attention, deeply moved by the story. Next, Jueming had the disciples recite the regulations. Everyone held up their books and read aloud. Bu Gui, jolted back to reality, quickly stared at his book and recited along, but he was always half a beat behind.

One afternoon, the disciples, seeking refuge from the heat, were idly chatting in the scripture repository, Ming Buxiang among them. Just as the conversation was getting lively, Ming Buxiang suddenly stood up. Everyone was startled and asked, "What's wrong?"

Ming Buxiang said, "I saw a rat."

The disciples were alarmed. Rats were the greatest taboo in the scripture repository. If a rat chewed on the books and caused damage, all of them would be punished.

Lü Changfeng quickly asked, "Are you serious?"

"It's possible my eyes were playing tricks on me."

"That's not a joke to be made," Lü Changfeng said. "Everyone, start looking!"

The disciples quickly split up to search, opening every storage room one by one and checking inside. They all intentionally or unintentionally avoided Bu Gui's room, planning to check it last. Only Ming Buxiang, completely unaware, walked up to Bu Gui's door. He pushed it open, only to see Bu Gui on his back with his stomach facing the sky, supporting himself on all fours, practicing the Iron Bridge—looking exactly like an overturned turtle.

In that moment, Ming Buxiang saw a look of terror on Bu Gui's face for the first time.

Bu Gui wanted to flip over, but his back was rigid and he couldn't move. Hearing the other disciples approaching, he was even more horrified, terrified that they would see him in this state and mock him endlessly.

In his panic, he saw Ming Buxiang quickly shut the door. He heard Ming Buxiang's voice say, "I've checked in here, no rat."

He then heard someone else say, "All the rooms have been searched, found nothing."

Ming Buxiang added, "Perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me, making everyone work for nothing." The voices of the others faded as they walked away. Only then did Bu Gui relax, hastily ending his practice session, his heart still pounding at the memory.

Bu Gui remembered Ming Buxiang; he had remembered him since their first meeting. Ming Buxiang had a handsome and elegant face, like a figure carved from jade. Though Lü Changfeng was handsome, compared to Ming Buxiang, his handsomeness seemed as uninteresting as that of a coarse ruffian.

He was somewhat jealous of that face, a face that was in itself the greatest mockery of him. The same eyes, ears, nose, and mouth—how could someone be born so refined, while he was born so coarse?

If there was one person Bu Gui never wanted to see him in a disgraceful state, it was Ming Buxiang. Yet today, of all days, Ming Buxiang had seen him in the disgraceful act of imitating a turtle.

'Will he tell the others what he saw today?'

That night, Bu Gui tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

During the morning sweeping the next day, Bu Gui peeked out from the Repository of Divine Arts and his eyes met Ming Buxiang's. He quickly ducked back in. He listened carefully to the conversations outside but heard nothing unusual, which put him slightly at ease.

For the next few days, nothing out of the ordinary happened, but the matter still hung heavily on Bu Gui's mind.

One afternoon, after the others had left, Bu Gui was dazing off in his room. He had no heart to practice, simply pacing back and forth when he suddenly heard a voice outside.

"Didn't you just borrow the _Śūraṅgama Sūtra_? Why are you borrowing the _Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra_ now?"

Another voice replied, "This disciple wishes to consult more scriptures."

Bu Gui's heart skipped a beat; he recognized Ming Buxiang's voice.

He then heard the first voice say, "How old are you that you can already comprehend these sutras?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "If I cannot comprehend them, I will memorize them. There are many masters in the Hall of True Concentration."

The other person laughed heartily. "Abbot Juejian said you were intelligent, and it's certainly true. Don't lose them."

Bu Gui pushed the door open a crack and saw Ming Buxiang standing in the long corridor. A short distance away, a young monk was stretching lazily as he walked off. He vaguely recognized the back as that of the scripture repository's cataloging monk, but he had almost never spoken to him.

Bu Gui hesitated for a long while. Seeing that Ming Buxiang was about to leave, he couldn't help but let out a cough. Ming Buxiang indeed turned around and saw Bu Gui half-hidden behind the door, seemingly hesitant and not speaking.

Bu Gui watched for a moment before finally extending a hand and beckoning to Ming Buxiang.

Ming Buxiang walked over. Bu Gui asked, "That day... you saw me... practicing. Did you tell any of the other senior brothers?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "No."

Bu Gui said, "Don't tell anyone, okay?"

Ming Buxiang said, "I can't."

Bu Gui became anxious and was about to ask why not, when Ming Buxiang added, "Practicing like that won't work. It won't cure you."

So that was what he meant. Bu Gui quickly said, "Don't worry about me, just don't tell anyone."

Ming Buxiang said, "A hunchback is difficult to treat. There are many medical books in the Repository of Natural History, and there are medicine monks in the temple. Why don't you ask them?"

"My master took me to ask long ago." Bu Gui shook his head. "They said it was hopeless."

Ming Buxiang said, "I didn't think anything of what I saw that day. But since you care so much and want me to keep it a secret, you'll have to do me a favor. Otherwise, I'll tell everyone."

Bu Gui asked, "What favor?"

Ming Buxiang said, "I come here to borrow sutras, but I can only borrow two at a time. How about you help me borrow two more?"

Bu Gui quickly replied, "I can't, I... I can't."

Ming Buxiang asked, "Why not?"

Bu Gui stammered, unable to explain, only saying, "Not that. Ask for something else."

Ming Buxiang said, "You can't read, can you?"

His secret exposed, Bu Gui's face flushed red. He lowered his head and asked, "How did you know?"

"That day during the recitation of the _Precepts for Buddhist Disciples_, you couldn't keep up. You were just mimicking the sounds. I noticed," Ming Buxiang said. "That's easy to solve. I can just teach you to read."

Bu Gui was stunned. He looked up and asked, "You'll teach me to read?"

Ming Buxiang nodded. "If you can't read, you can't help me borrow books." With that, he walked straight into the room.

Bu Gui couldn't stop him in time. The room was originally used for storage and had no windows; even during the day, it was too dark to see clearly.

"It's too dark in here, you can't see properly. Let's go outside."

Bu Gui shook his head. "I don't go outside."

Ming Buxiang nodded. "Then I'll go get a brush and paper. Wait for me."

Ming Buxiang left as soon as he finished speaking, leaving Bu Gui anxious and uncertain. After a while, Ming Buxiang returned as promised with an oil lamp and the four treasures of the study.

"I'll start by teaching you the simple characters. Have you learned one, two, three, four?" Ming Buxiang lit the candle, spread the paper, and ground the ink, asking as he wrote the five characters for _Sutra of Forty-Two Sections._

Bu Gui said, "I can recognize the numbers one through ten."

"Then I'll first teach you the characters for 'section' and 'sutra'. Tomorrow, you can help me borrow this sutra."

Then he thought for a moment and said, "No, that won't work. If Uncle-Master Liaojing finds out you can't read, he'll definitely ask why you're borrowing it. You'll have to learn a bit more so you can answer if he questions you."

Bu Gui's heart pounded. He normally avoided outsiders, only going to the dining hall for meals, and even then he kept his head down, rushing there and back without talking or making eye contact with anyone. He had always wanted to learn to read but was too ashamed to ask. That Ming Buxiang was willing to teach him was more than he could have hoped for. After thinking it over, and fearing that Ming Buxiang might reveal his secret, he could only say, "Alright, I'll help you."

Ming Buxiang looked at him and suddenly smiled, a smile as brilliant and warm as the afternoon sun in autumn. Bu Gui stared at the smile, thinking, 'How can he smile so beautifully?' He seemed almost mesmerized.

From that day on, Ming Buxiang came to Bu Gui's room every afternoon to teach him how to read. When Bu Gui asked about Ming Buxiang's background and learned that he, too, was an orphan whose master had gone missing, he felt a sense of kinship, and the two gradually grew close.

After that, Bu Gui stopped his physical training and focused entirely on learning to read. His memory and comprehension were not exceptional, but he was extremely diligent. He would start studying as soon as his chores were done, and after Ming Buxiang left, he would review until late at night. In less than a month, he had learned over a hundred common characters.

The hardest part of learning characters was the foundation. Once that was established, progress could be rapid. Ming Buxiang then told him to go borrow the _Sutra of Forty-Two Sections_. Bu Gui demurred several times, but Ming Buxiang just shook his head and insisted. Left with no choice, Bu Gui had to brace himself, go to the Prajna Repository, take a copy of the _Sutra of Forty-Two Sections_, and ask the monk in charge to borrow it.

The cataloging monk was a young man named Liaojing. He was surprised to see Bu Gui. "It's rare to see you borrowing a sutra."

Bu Gui's face burned and his heart pounded with shame. He lowered his head, unable to reply. Liaojing didn't press him, only saying, "If you have any difficulties while reading the sutra, you can come ask me. If I don't know the answer, I can help you ask a sutra monk."

Bu Gui hadn't expected him to be so friendly. He thanked him repeatedly, took the book, and hurried away.

Ming Buxiang was already waiting in the room. When Bu Gui entered, he let out a huge sigh of relief, as if he had been granted a pardon, and panted heavily.

Ming Buxiang said calmly, "It wasn't that hard, was it?"

Bu Gui nodded and handed the sutra to Ming Buxiang, but Ming Buxiang didn't take it.

"I can finish this book in a couple of days. If you return it too quickly, they'll get suspicious. We might as well use this sutra to learn characters first."

And so, Ming Buxiang taught Bu Gui to read, also explaining the meaning of the scripture. Bu Gui's understanding of the text was partial at first, but gradually he began to grasp its meaning.

A few days later, Ming Buxiang asked Bu Gui to borrow another book, this time a miscellaneous text used for primers, the _Thousand Character Classic_.

"My master said the _Thousand Character Classic_ is the fastest way to learn characters," Ming Buxiang said. "You've already learned many of the characters inside, so it shouldn't be difficult."

After studying it for a few days, a thought suddenly occurred to Bu Gui.

'He asked me to help him borrow sutras, so why are we borrowing the _Thousand Character Classic_?'

This thought led to another.

'His talk of borrowing sutras was just an excuse. He actually wants me to learn to write and to interact with people.'

Upon this realization, Bu Gui was overcome with emotion and gratitude. He looked at Ming Buxiang, stammering, unable to speak. Seeing his strange expression, Ming Buxiang asked, "What's wrong?"

Bu Gui said, "You... you borrowed the book for my sake?"

Ming Buxiang neither confirmed nor denied it, only saying, "There's no rush with borrowing books. You can help me later." He added, "If there are any books you want to read, you can borrow them yourself."

Bu Gui was moved. "Besides my master, you're the first person to treat me so well. Why?"

Ming Buxiang thought for a moment. "You're like me. No parents, no master. Maybe I see you as a friend."

'A friend!' The word struck a chord in Bu Gui's heart. The only relative he remembered in his entire life was the master he had spent a brief two years with; he had never had a friend. Ming Buxiang was the first person to call him a friend, and he couldn't help but feel emotional.

"I... I've never had a friend... Do you have many friends?" Bu Gui asked.

"Back in the Hall of Upright Action, there was someone who carried night soil with me. He might have counted as a friend. But later he helped Benyue bully me and stole my copy of the _Precepts for Buddhist Disciples_." As he spoke, he paused in thought for a moment before continuing, "There are also friends who can harm you."

Bu Gui said hurriedly, "I won't be that kind! I don't have any friends besides you!"

Ming Buxiang said, "You can make more friends."

Bu Gui lowered his head. "With... with how I look, no one would want to be my friend."

"The senior brothers in the Hall of True Insight are all good people," Ming Buxiang said. "You've already tried once, why not try a few more times?"

"How?" Bu Gui asked.

Ming Buxiang said, "Tomorrow, during sweeping, walk out of the Repository of Divine Arts and greet them."

"What do you mean?" Bu Gui asked for more detail.

"Just a greeting. One a day is enough," Ming Buxiang said. "You'll understand after that."

The next day, after finishing his sweeping, as the time was nearly up, Bu Gui remembered Ming Buxiang's words but hesitated to act.

He remembered when he was a child, trying to get close to other children either scared them to tears or earned him a beating and cursing from their parents.

He was afraid. He was afraid of those disdainful looks, that scornful attitude, as if he were a monster that should never have been born.

He had hidden in Shaolin Temple for ten years, building his world within that small, solitary room. That was everything to him. And now he had to step out of that world and into another place that had once been so hostile to him.

'It's just one greeting,' he thought. 'What more can I lose?'

He took a deep breath, feeling his legs weaken slightly, and slowly walked step by step toward the small, cast-iron door.

The iron door was heavy; it was hard to open when closed, and hard to close when open. He stood in the doorway, letting everyone see him. Soon, someone noticed him, and before long, all the sweeping disciples were looking over.

"Everyone..." His mind went blank, he didn't know what to say. Finally, he managed, "Good morning."

It was nearly noon by then. Seeing his awkwardness, the disciples all roared with laughter. Bu Gui felt humiliated and was about to retreat, but then he heard them calling back, "Good morning!" "Good morning!"

He could tell there was no malice in their words, only surprise at most.

After that, he went from a single greeting each day, to greeting them when he saw them and when he left, and gradually to simple conversations of two or three sentences. In less than three months, he had become a part of their circle. He could feel that while they had been a bit afraid of him at first, they now treated him normally. Sometimes they would tell him jokes; being of a dull nature and slow to react, he could only laugh along foolishly when he didn't understand.

He might not have understood the jokes, but his laughter was sincere.

In less than half a year, he had learned to read and made friends—more than one friend.

All of this was because of Ming Buxiang.

He was as grateful to Ming Buxiang as he was to his master, Liaoyin.

One afternoon, Lü Changfeng suddenly suggested that everyone go for a walk on the back mountain. Some disciples said they needed to go back and ask their masters for permission, while others agreed on the spot.

Lü Changfeng asked Ming Buxiang, "We're all going for a walk on the back mountain, are you coming?" Then he turned his head and asked, "Bu Gui, are you coming?"

Bu Gui was caught off guard by the question and quickly looked at Ming Buxiang. Ming Buxiang nodded, so Bu Gui nodded as well and said yes.

Lü Changfeng didn't notice the silent exchange between the two.

And so, a group of several dozen monks and lay disciples gathered outside the Hall of True Insight and set off for the back mountain.

Ming Buxiang had been to the back mountain a few times, brought there by Liaoxin, of course. The scenery along the way was beautiful, filled with the chirping of insects and birds, and the group chatted and laughed merrily. When they reached an open clearing, Lü Changfeng directed them to gather firewood. One disciple took out tea leaves, while others produced cakes and fruits, which they all shared. They sat on the ground, talking and laughing in harmony.

Bu Gui had not left the temple grounds in ten years. Although this was only a trip to the back mountain, it felt like seeing the light of day again. He felt his spirits lift and his body relax, and he walked around everywhere, filled with excitement.

The group chatted about the history of the martial sects, mentioning how First Seat Juekong had led a large contingent of monks out of the temple more than half a year ago and had been gone for over two months.

Lü Changfeng smiled. "First Seat Juekong went to attend the Kunlun council to elect the new alliance leader."

Someone asked, "Isn't the position of alliance leader just rotated among the six major sects? All Qingcheng, Mount Hua, and Tang Gate can do is drool. Is there really a need for an election?"

Lü Changfeng laughed. "That's where you're wrong. The rule is that they are elected. Even if it's a rotation in practice, they still have to go through the motions for the sake of appearances. It's the only time every ten years that the leaders of the Nine Great Families can gather in one place."

"It's said that the sect leaders attend in person, but First Seat Juekong isn't the abbot, is he?" a disciple asked.

"Are you confused? When is the Kunlun council? The fourth month!" Lü Changfeng asked with a smile, "What major event happens in the fourth month?"

Even Bu Gui could answer this question. The disciples all answered in unison, "Buddha's Birthday!"

Lü Changfeng laughed. "Buddha's Birthday is a major event for Shaolin. For this reason, it was decided decades ago that unless the date is changed, Shaolin can only send a representative. For the past several decades, unless it was our turn to be the alliance leader and attendance was mandatory, we've always sent someone of significant standing to represent the abbot."

"It's only because First Seat Juekong wasn't here that Abbot Juejian was able to drag out Uncle-Master Liaoxin's case for so long," Lü Changfeng continued.

This brought the conversation back to the case of Liaoxin's disappearance. Several months prior, Juejian had submitted the autopsy results to the Universal Virtue Court, and First Seat Juekong had concluded the matter as "suspected death by mutual combat, pending further investigation." This had caused a huge stir within Shaolin Temple, with endless rumors circulating, and the sole key figure in the middle of it all was the missing Liaoxin. During this time, many Hall Monks had visited Ming Buxiang, but to no avail.

As they discussed this, they each began to speculate, but with Ming Buxiang right there, they felt it was inappropriate to debate it further. So they changed the subject again, talking about which abbot was strict and which was lenient, interspersed with various bits of gossip.

One disciple said, "Have you guys heard? First Seat Juekong originally had a family at the foot of the mountain!"

Several disciples laughed heartily. "Who doesn't know that! First Seat Juekong was forty when he was tonsured. It'd be strange if he didn't have a family."

That disciple said, "He looks so sanctimonious, I thought he came from an orthodox monk background. Only later did I find out..."

Ming Buxiang suddenly asked, "Orthodox monks, secular monks, how are they different?"

Everyone looked at Ming Buxiang, surprised by his question. But seeing how young he was, one of them said, "You don't know the difference?"

Ming Buxiang said, "Master Liaoxin mentioned it. Orthodox monks enter the temple for the purpose of cultivation, while secular monks do not. A disciple of a secular monk who gets tonsured is still a secular monk. Only a disciple of an orthodox monk can become an orthodox monk."

A disciple said, "That's more or less it. Let me tell you, some secular monks only observe the precepts within the temple. Once they leave, never mind those with families, some of them eat, drink, whore, and gamble."

At this, many of the disciples showed looks of contempt.

"When I went to the Buddha Capital to buy things before, I got to know a few disciples from the Earth Treasury Court. My master specially warned me to have less contact with disciples of secular monks," a tonsured disciple said, sipping his tea. "When I ran into them recently, I didn't even greet them."

"My master said the same thing," another youth said. "He said those people are a bad influence."

"The Hall of Upright Action is where it gets interesting. I heard from a senior brother there that as soon as you enter the dining hall, the orthodox monks sit on one side, and the secular monks sit on the other, with a whole row of empty seats in between, like they're fire and water."

The antagonism between the orthodox and secular monks gradually unfolded, a turbulent undercurrent that even the disciples were beginning to feel.

"Don't talk nonsense," Lü Changfeng said. "Junior Brother Ming still lives in the Hall of Upright Action, we can just ask him." He looked at Ming Buxiang. "Is it really like that?"

Ming Buxiang said, "There aren't enough seats in the dining hall to leave a whole row empty."

Everyone burst into laughter.

Suddenly, a familiar voice cursed, "Look at the little bastard, living quite the good life!"

Everyone looked and saw a monk with a face full of dark spots. It was Benyue, who had somehow also come to the back mountain today.

Benyue strode forward, cursing, "Your master is a murderer on the run, and here you are, enjoying yourself!"

With that, he kicked Ming Buxiang in the back, sending him sprawling to the ground.

With a furious roar, Bu Gui rushed forward and wrapped his arms around Benyue's waist. By now, Bu Gui already saw Ming Buxiang as family; how could he stand by and watch him be bullied? The moment he saw him get hit, he charged. Benyue was startled by Bu Gui's fearsome appearance. Bu Gui's strength was immense, and he was about to flip him to the ground. But Benyue was not one to be trifled with. He caught Bu Gui under the arms, locking onto his meridians, then drove his knee up into Bu Gui's stomach. Bu Gui grunted in pain but still managed to forcefully throw Benyue off. Benyue stumbled back a few steps, then unleashed two quick punches, left and right, striking Bu Gui in the face. Bu Gui's skin was thick, and though he staggered back, he was ready to fight again, but several disciples rushed up to hold him back.

Lü Changfeng stood up and shouted angrily, "What right do you have to hit someone?!"

Benyue said, "The bastard is a disciple of the Hall of Upright Action. What business is it of your Hall of True Insight?"

Lü Changfeng retorted, "A sweeper has the right to discipline disciples? Is that a rule in the Hall of Upright Action?"

Benyue cursed, "What's wrong with being a sweeper? Aren't you a sweeper too? What gives you the right to lecture me?"

"You hurt my friend, so that makes it my business!"

Ming Buxiang tugged on Lü Changfeng's sleeve and said lightly, "It doesn't matter."

Benyue swung another slap at Ming Buxiang, cursing, "Who said you could speak?"

He knew that Ming Buxiang no longer had Liaoxin to back him, and with his special status, he had no master to stand up for him either, so Benyue decided to bully him all the more.

Lü Changfeng wasted no more words, spinning to deliver a kick at Benyue.

"Come on, then!" Benyue roared.

The two began to trade blows. A few disciples from the Hall of True Insight shielded Ming Buxiang and Bu Gui, while others who tried to intervene were halted by Lü Changfeng's shout.

They began with an exchange of fists and feet, using only simple grappling techniques, where Lü Changfeng’s power was clearly superior. When Benyue saw he couldn't win, he shifted from fists to palms, striking out continuously as though he had grown several more arms, his palm-shadows blurring together.

This was the Thounsand Arms Guanyin Palm, already a high-grade martial art in the monastery, not something used in an ordinary brawl. Although Benyue's internal energy was shallow, his forms were practiced. He relied on being more stoutly built than Lü Changfeng, assuming his internal energy must be deeper, and sought to win with this advantage.

He had not expected his calculations to be so wrong. Lü Changfeng suddenly thrust out a palm, and a powerful gust of wind rushed forth—it was the Great Vajra Palm.

In terms of martial theory, the Vajra Palm emphasized immense power, while the Guanyin Palm prioritized agility; each had its own strengths. Yet while techniques may have no hierarchy, a practitioner’s power certainly does. Though Lü Changfeng was only in his early twenties, his internal energy was far more profound than Benyue's. For every three or five palms Benyue sent his way, Lü Changfeng needed only a single palm in return to force him back again and again.

After a few more exchanges, Lü Changfeng landed a palm on Benyue’s shoulder, knocking him back several steps. Having gotten the worst of it, Benyue knew he was outmatched and cursed, "You're just relying on your numbers today! I'll accept this loss for now, but let's see how long you can protect this lowlife!" With that, he turned and stormed away.

One of the disciples jeered after him, "Don't go! We'll pick one of our weaker guys to fight you. One-on-one, we won't bully you!"

The crowd roared with laughter, cheering, "Senior Brother Lü is amazing!" "What skill, Senior Brother Lü!" They swarmed around Lü Changfeng as if he were a renowned hero.

"Are you alright?" Lü Changfeng asked Bu Gui. Bu Gui shook his head and said, "I'm fine," but his expression was resentful.

"You've offended Benyue," Ming Buxiang said. "He'll find a chance to retaliate."

Someone else added, "If he reports this, I'm afraid Senior Brother Lü will be punished by his master."

"That cur is a secular monk," Lü Changfeng said. "My master will praise me for hitting him."

This sent the crowd into another round of laughter.

Lü Changfeng then said to Ming Buxiang, "You live in the Hall of Upright Action, so he'll find trouble with you sooner or later, and it won't be easy to avoid. The Hall of True Insight still has an empty room. Are you sure you won't move in?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head again. "That was my master's room."

The onlookers were quite moved to see him so devoted to his master. Lü Changfeng said, "If he bullies you again, tell me. I'll take care of it for you."

"Fighting is forbidden within the monastery, and he has friends," Ming Buxiang said. He then added, "But now that Senior Brother Lü is around, if he tries to bother me, Senior Brother Lü will help me."

Lü Changfeng roared with laughter. "It's nothing, don't you worry. If he dares to make a scene, I'll tell my master how he's been bullying you. The authorities will see that justice is done. All your senior and junior brothers in the Hall of True Insight have your back."

As soon as he finished speaking, the assembled brothers declared in unison, "That's right, we all have your back!"

Ming Buxiang looked at the crowd and suddenly gave a faint smile, as warm as the morning sun. Since Ming Buxiang had joined the Hall of True Insight, no one but Bu Gui had ever seen him smile; everyone had assumed he was grieving over Liaoxin's disappearance. Seeing him smile now, they all felt they had done a good deed and were filled with joy.

All except for Bu Gui.

He stood behind the crowd, a lonely expression on his face.

That night, Bu Gui tossed and turned, unable to sleep soundly. Early the next morning, while cleaning the Repository of Divine Arts, he couldn't resist secretly pulling out a manual for the _Dragon's Claw_ and tucking it into his robes.

He chose this particular manual because he could not understand most of the characters, but the character for "dragon" alone felt majestic and powerful to him.

That afternoon, as Ming Buxiang was teaching him to read, Bu Gui asked about the history between him and Benyue.

"He used to be the work detail leader for the monks in the Hall of Upright Action, just like Senior Brother Sorrow," Ming Buxiang explained. "But he oppressed his subordinates, only giving orders and never doing any work himself; everyone feared him, but no one respected him."

"But Senior Brother Lü is so well-loved by everyone, isn't he?" Bu Gui asked.

"He's enthusiastic and always helping his fellow brothers, so naturally he is well-loved. If you were to help them out often, you would be loved too."

Bu Gui nodded and asked no more questions.

After that, Bu Gui began to proactively help his fellow brothers. He learned that if any of the brothers needed supplies, they had to be purchased in the Buddha Capital, a full five li away. Some of the brothers could not leave the monastery without their master's permission, making it necessary for someone to purchase things on their behalf, and if they couldn't find someone going anyway, they had to ask around for help. Bu Gui had no master and could come and go as he pleased, so he volunteered to purchase supplies for all the brothers. At first, everyone felt a bit awkward and tried to refuse, but seeing Bu Gui's persistence, they accepted his kindness.

Though short and hunchbacked, Bu Gui was strong, and carrying any amount of goods was no trouble for him. Whenever he returned from a shopping trip, everyone would thank him and offer some praise. Though Bu Gui would be drenched in sweat from exhaustion, he would always smile happily.

As time went on, everyone gradually grew accustomed to it. Whenever they wanted to buy something but didn't want to make the long trip, they would entrust the task to Bu Gui. Sometimes, something as small as a missing toothbrush would send Bu Gui on a ten-li round trip.

In the twelfth month, a heavy snow fell on Mount Shaoshi, followed by the new year. Although Shaolin Monastery celebrated Buddha's Birthday instead, it was still a time for festivity. After that came the birthdays of the bodhisattvas Guanyin and Puxian, and these few months left the disciples of the Hall of True Insight utterly exhausted.

In the blink of an eye, it was the third month and the warmth of spring had returned. One day, someone came knocking on Ming Buxiang's door, saying that Abbot Juejian requested his presence at the Hall of Upright Action.

"I had meant to come see you sooner," Juejian said. "But the Hall of Upright Action is beset with trivial matters, and I could never find the time. After a while, I forgot, and only recently remembered."

"This disciple knows how to take care of himself. It would be best if Master could be found soon," Ming Buxiang said. He paused for a moment before continuing, "It would also quell the disputes within the monastery."

Juejian raised an eyebrow. "I hear you have borrowed many books in the Hall of True Insight. Which ones have you read?" Ming Buxiang reported them one by one, and Juejian occasionally quizzed him. Ming Buxiang's fluent answers earned Juejian's admiration.

After the examination was over, Juejian asked, "I am very pleased with your diligent studies in the Hall of True Insight, as I'm sure your master would be. What gift would you like? I will give it to you."

"This disciple does not need a gift," Ming Buxiang replied.

"This is a reward, not a debt," Juejian said. "It is to encourage your diligence. If you remember this, you should strive to be even more diligent."

Ming Buxiang thought for a moment. "I would like a pair of shoes."

Juejian asked with confusion, "Shoes?"

"Yes, a pair of shoes," Ming Buxiang confirmed.

Juejian laughed heartily. "What's so difficult about that? I'll have someone send them to you in a couple of days."

"Thank you, Abbot," Ming Buxiang said with a bow.

Juejian offered a few more words of encouragement before sending him back.

Two incidents occurred in the Hall of True Insight that March.

The first was that Senior Brother Sorrow passed the martial trial and was appointed as a Proctor Monk, requiring him to leave Shaolin Monastery for Shanxi.

Everyone was happy for him but also saddened by the departure. At the same time, the position of work detail leader became vacant. There was little suspense about the role; by custom, the departing disciple would make a recommendation for the abbot's approval, and it was certain to be Lü Changfeng.

At the farewell banquet, the disciples pooled their money to buy Senior Brother Sorrow a set of monastic robes and shoes, which were naturally purchased by Bu Gui from down the mountain. Everyone expressed their feelings about the parting and said their goodbyes one by one.

When it was Ming Buxiang's turn, Senior Brother Sorrow said, "Since you entered the Hall of True Insight, I've been less involved in managing affairs and have seen you less. I haven't been able to teach you much, and I feel quite bad about it now."

"The brothers in the Hall of True Insight are all very good people. Senior Brother Lü is very good, and Senior Brother Bu is also very good," Ming Buxiang replied. "It's just a little sad, and I expect I'll have to be sad again next year."

"What do you mean by that?" Senior Brother Sorrow asked.

"In less than two years, it should be Senior Brother Lü's turn to receive the Writ of Chivalry and leave the monastery," Ming Buxiang replied.

Senior Brother Sorrow's eyebrows twitched as he thought, 'Junior Brother Lü is highly skilled; he might be able to leave the mountain in less than two years. I've been busy preparing for the martial trial these past six months and have neglected many of my work duties, struggling to manage both. I relied completely on his help. After I leave, who will Junior Brother Lü find to help him?'

As he thought this, he couldn't help but look toward Bu Gui.

At that moment, Lü Changfeng raised his teacup and said loudly, "To Senior Brother Sorrow! May your journey be smooth, may you enter the Hall swiftly, and may you one day return to Shaolin!"

The others also raised their cups, their voices joining in cheerful laughter.

Two days after Senior Brother Sorrow left, Abbot Jueming passed down an order: Bu Gui would replace Benyan and become the new work detail leader for the group.

Upon hearing of this appointment, not just Lü Changfeng, but everyone was stunned. Bu Gui himself was also taken aback.

Although Lü Changfeng had considered that being the work detail leader would affect his participation in the martial trial, he had high self-regard and felt that managing both was not impossible; Senior Brother Sorrow's good intentions seemed a bit presumptuous. Bu Gui had become quite popular with the brothers recently, and he was of a suitable age. The work detail didn't require great talent; since he had no ambition for the Writ of Chivalry and wouldn't be leaving the monastery, he was indeed suited for the position. But for some reason, Lü Changfeng felt a sense of stifled resentment.

Bu Gui accepted the position and stammered, "I... ah... I'll do my best." Seeing him stutter and at a loss, the others felt their confidence in him waver a little.

That afternoon, Ming Buxiang came to teach Bu Gui how to read. Over the past half-year, Bu Gui had learned many common characters and would occasionally ask Ming Buxiang about more obscure ones. Although Ming Buxiang was young, in Bu Gui's heart, he was already half a teacher. Whenever he was undecided about something, he would ask him.

"Junior Brother Ming," Bu Gui asked, "I... I've become the work detail leader. Ah... what... what should I do?"

"I've never been a work detail leader, so I don't know how to teach you," Ming Buxiang replied. "But leading by example is always right, isn't it?"

Bu Gui asked what this meant, and was told it meant to set an example with one's own actions, to do more, and those under you would be convinced.

Bu Gui understood, but he did far too much.

Previously, when fetching water, each person carried ten buckets. Bu Gui, relying on his great strength, carried several dozen extra, so everyone else had to carry two fewer.

When chopping firewood, Bu Gui alone could do the work of five men, and everyone else chopped a few bundles less.

During cleaning, Bu Gui was always at the forefront, moving heavy objects and personally dealing with years of accumulated grime.

He was only responsible for doing the work, not assigning it, but every one of his fellow brothers was very happy, all praising Bu Gui. Since he had taken office, everyone's workload had become much lighter. Bu Gui also laughed heartily, his gratitude for Ming Buxiang deepening.

The second major event of the third month also concerned Bu Gui.

He lost the money he was using to buy snacks for the other disciples.

"I'm sure I had it with me!" Bu Gui said, extremely vexed and sad. "When I got to the Buddha Capital, I reached into my pocket, and it was all gone..."

"Could you have been pickpocketed?" one disciple asked. "The Buddha Capital is full of thieves. I told you to be careful."

"I was very careful," Bu Gui said dejectedly. "I'm sorry, everyone."

"It's just a matter of a few dozen coins, don't worry about it," Lü Changfeng comforted him.

The monks of the Hall of True Insight were all orthodox monks and had no income other than their stipend; their allowance was small, and some relied on support from their families. Many had participated in this snack purchase, contributing amounts ranging from a few hundred coins to a few dozen. Though the total was not large, the loss was painful.

But being pained was useless, and Bu Gui couldn't pay it back. Besides, he had been running their errands for months, and his perfectly good pair of shoes had been worn to shreds from the travel; how could they blame him for losing the money?

Bu Gui returned to his room, sullen and unhappy. Just then, there was a knock on the door. It was Ming Buxiang, carrying a package.

"Junior Brother Ming," Bu Gui said in frustration, "are they still angry with me?"

"Senior Brother Bu, have you heard the story of the broken oil bottle?" Ming Buxiang asked.

"What story?" Bu Gui asked.

"A man went to the market and bought a bottle of oil," Ming Buxiang began. "He was walking with it in his arms when he slipped and dropped the bottle, shattering it. The man didn't even look back and just kept walking. A passerby quickly called out, 'Hey, you broke your oil bottle!' Senior Brother Bu, can you guess how the man replied?"

Bu Gui was not very clever. He scratched his head and said, "I don't know."

"The oil bottle is already broken," Ming Buxiang said. "What good would looking back do?"

Bu Gui was taken aback, seeming to understand yet not fully comprehending.

"The money is already lost, so what's the use of regret?" Ming Buxiang said. "From now on, just help the brothers a little more."

Understanding finally dawned on Bu Gui, and he nodded repeatedly.

Ming Buxiang crouched down, opened the bag, and took out a brand-new pair of monastic shoes. "Try these on. See if they fit."

"What are these?" Bu Gui asked quickly.

"This is a gift from Abbot Juejian. I thought they would suit you," Ming Buxiang said. "Just don't tell anyone, it would be awkward for Abbot Juejian if he found out."

"Then what do I say if someone asks?" Bu Gui asked.

"Just say you bought them yourself. You get a bit of a stipend for your service in the hall," Ming Buxiang said.

"These shoes are too nice, I can't accept them," Bu Gui added.

"Your old pair is already worn through from all your trips up and down the mountain and can't be worn anymore," Ming Buxiang said. "With these new shoes, you'll be able to walk faster when you buy things for the brothers in the future."

Bu Gui was deeply moved. He hugged Ming Buxiang and wept, "Junior Brother Ming, you are such a good person!" Ming Buxiang waited for him to finish crying, then had him try on the shoes. They were a little narrow, but they fit well enough.

The day after putting on the new shoes, Bu Gui noticed that everyone was looking at him differently. He thought it was because they were still upset about the lost money, thinking to himself that this group was so petty, not at all as generous as Junior Brother Ming.

However, from that day on, no one asked him to go down the mountain for purchases again. Slowly, he also began to feel that he was being isolated, and he heard inexplicable whispers behind his back.

Bu Gui grew anxious. These were "friends" he had worked so hard to gain, and he didn't understand what had gone wrong. He could only work even harder, taking on more tasks to please this group of friends.

Gradually, the brothers of the Hall of True Insight also became a bit lazy, no longer as diligent in their cleaning duties. The less diligent they were, the more Bu Gui had to do, and the more Bu Gui did, the less diligent they became.

In the fourth month, Juejian came to the Hall of True Insight to see Abbot Jueming. He saw Ming Buxiang, Bu Gui, and other disciples chopping firewood and noticed that Ming Buxiang was still wearing his old shoes, which puzzled him. He saw Ming Buxiang shake his head at him, and followed Ming Buxiang's gaze to see the new shoes on Bu Gui's feet.

He knew Bu Gui's story, and he knew that after Ming Buxiang came to the Hall of True Insight, Bu Gui, who hadn't been seen for ten years, was willing to leave his room and even grow close to other disciples. He thought this must be Ming Buxiang's doing. He gave Ming Buxiang a slight smile and a nod of acknowledgment before leaving.

'This child hasn't disappointed me after all,' Juejian thought. But he hadn't taken two steps before he turned back, frowning. After a moment, he closed his eyes, turned, and left.

A short while later, a Hall Monk came and called Bu Gui over.

"How much firewood needs to be chopped today?" the Hall Monk asked.

"One hundred bundles," Bu Gui replied.

"How many did you chop, and how many did that child chop?" the Hall Monk asked again.

"I chopped twenty bundles, and Junior Brother Ming chopped ten," Bu Gui said.

"The two of you chopped thirty bundles, and the remaining seventy are to be split among more than twenty disciples?"

"Senior Brother Lü also chopped five bundles," Bu Gui quickly added, but his explanation was not accepted.

"You are the work detail leader, yet the labor is so unfair. How are you managing things?"

Bu Gui stammered, "But we can finish it today. The work wasn't delayed past the deadline."

"A work detail leader's job isn't to see who does the most work, but to distribute labor fairly, to supervise and manage, so everyone does their part," the Hall Monk said. "If it were a competition of who works the most, we would just pick the strongest person to be the leader. Why would we need to choose someone senior?"

Bu Gui was speechless.

"From now on, labor distribution must be fair. I will come to supervise next time. If I see anyone slacking off again, you will be the one punished."

Bu Gui meekly agreed.

But he could no longer manage the brothers of the Hall of True Insight.

No matter how much or how little work he assigned, it was never finished. Though the number of people hadn't changed, the main hall of the scripture repository was never as bright as it used to be, and the chopping of firewood and fetching of water were delayed every day, earning him many scoldings.

When Bu Gui got anxious, he would say a few words to everyone. After a while, words had no effect, so he would scold them.

But scolding was also useless. Instead, over this period, it had been a long time since anyone had invited him for an outing, for tea, or for a casual chat.

He finally realized that he was being ostracized.

But he didn't know why.

Only when Lü Changfeng occasionally urged them on would the other disciples work seriously.

No one paid him any mind.

He anxiously sought help from Ming Buxiang, who only advised him to let it go and suggested he talk to Lü Changfeng.

But Lü Changfeng always deliberately avoided him.

One day, in a fit of rage, he actually struck one of his junior brothers. Everyone seemed to be frightened by this and finally started to work diligently.

He remembered what Ming Buxiang had told him about Benyue. He felt remorseful and apologized to the junior brother, who gave a perfunctory reply before scurrying far away.

After that day, the other brothers began to work diligently again. The work was finally completed on time, and Bu Gui once again received praise from the Hall Monk.

This method, though crude, was effective. Whenever the brothers slacked off, he only had to roar a few times, or even resort to violence, and the remaining brothers would start working. It seemed no one complained about him to the Hall Monk either.

But Lü Changfeng stopped working.

He always looked at Bu Gui with contempt. No matter how Bu Gui shouted and screamed, he remained unmoved, as if he was trying to provoke Bu Gui into hitting him.

And the work that Lü Changfeng didn't do was handled by Ming Buxiang, which made Bu Gui feel even more guilty toward Ming Buxiang.

One day, Bu Gui finally couldn't take it anymore and threw a punch at Lü Changfeng. But Lü Changfeng, as if he had been waiting for this moment, easily dodged it, grabbed Bu Gui's arm, and twisted. The pain made Bu Gui cry out.

He heard all the brothers clapping and cheering.

He felt utterly humiliated, as humiliated as when he was a child and other children's parents shooed him away from their kids, as humiliated as when other children threw stones at him.

Only Ming Buxiang anxiously urged Lü Changfeng to let go.

Only Ming Buxiang was his friend, his first and last friend.

"I've brought you harm," Ming Buxiang said in Bu Gui's room, handing him a bottle of liniment for bruises.

"It has nothing to do with you," Bu Gui said. "They hate me."

"They think you stole their money," Ming Buxiang said, pointing to the new shoes on his feet. "They think you bought these shoes with the stolen money. I heard them saying it."

Bu Gui finally understood. So that was the reason for their growing alienation.

"I explained it to them, but they don't believe me," Ming Buxiang said.

"Then what should I do?" Bu Gui asked.

"Tomorrow, I'll go find Abbot Juejian to be a witness and clear your name. Then they will believe you," Ming Buxiang said.

"Will it work?" Bu Gui asked.

"Give the position of work detail leader to Senior Brother Lü," Ming Buxiang said. "Senior Brother Lü will forgive you. If Senior Brother Lü forgives you, the other brothers will forgive you."

Forgive? After Ming Buxiang left, Bu Gui lay in bed, tossing and turning.

For the first time, he didn't believe Ming Buxiang, because he had cursed them and hit them.

As long as Lü Changfeng was around, he would never be able to regain everyone's trust, because everyone liked Lü Changfeng. He was handsome, tall, skilled in martial arts, well-mannered, and would stand up for justice.

Compared to him, he was just a hunchback.

These past days, Bu Gui had finally stepped outside his room. The world outside was vast, but it was too heavy, so heavy he couldn't stand up straight. He felt as if he had shrunk back into that small, dark room, alone in the cramped space, practicing the Iron Bridge, desperately trying to straighten his hunched back even a fraction more.

He finally understood; he had always been jealous of Lü Changfeng.

He took the Dragon's Claw manual from his drawer, tucked it into his robes, and slipped out under the cover of night.

He knew where Lü Changfeng's room was. He was not a thief, but he could make Lü Changfeng one. Stealing a secret manual from the scripture repository was a serious crime. If he reported tomorrow morning that a book had been stolen from the repository, all the monks' quarters in the Hall of True Insight would be searched, and Lü Changfeng would be caught red-handed.

He could also say that Lü Changfeng was the one who stole the money. With Ming Buxiang's testimony proving that his own shoes were not bought with stolen funds, Lü Changfeng would be the most likely thief.

Then he and his 'friends' could clear up the 'misunderstanding.' This was the only way he could regain their trust.

He tiptoed, avoiding the patrolling monks, and arrived outside Lü Changfeng's room. It was a two-room dwelling. He gently pushed the main door open. Lü Changfeng lived in the room on the right. He gave it a push—damn it, the door was locked.

He went around to the back and saw an open window, so he climbed in through it.

He had no experience climbing through windows. Just as he thought he could squeeze through, his hump hit the window frame, making a loud noise. He was terrified. Before he could pull back, Lü Changfeng had been awakened. Seeing a figure outside the window, he shouted, "Thief, there's a thief!"

Lü Changfeng rushed over. Bu Gui tried to back out of the window, but his hump was stuck. He was immobilized for a moment and Lü Changfeng grabbed him by the collar. Recognizing Bu Gui, Lü Changfeng exclaimed in surprise, "Why is it you? What are you doing breaking into my room in the middle of the night?!"

Bu Gui's mind went blank with a roar, everything a blur. All he could think was to struggle and escape. If he were caught here, he would never be able to make friends again in his life. But Lü Changfeng's martial arts were far superior to his; how could he possibly break free? In the heat of the moment, with no time to think, Bu Gui's right hand formed a claw. He thrust forward, using a move from the Dragon's Claw he had practiced for over half a year—'Shatter the Adamant'—and clawed at Lü Changfeng's throat.

Lü Changfeng knew the extent of Bu Gui's martial skill and paid little heed to the attack. His hands still gripping Bu Gui's collar, he simply turned his neck to dodge.

But he was wrong. Bu Gui's claw still caught his throat. With a powerful wrench, he tore Lü Changfeng's windpipe out. Lü Changfeng clutched his throat, unable to breathe. He gasped for air, and in a few moments, collapsed to the ground, dead.

Bu Gui did not escape either. The patrolling monks and disciples, drawn by the commotion, seized him and pinned him to the ground.

The incident shook Shaolin Monastery. A monk of the Hall of True Insight framing a fellow disciple, murdering a brother, stealing a book, killing a person, and secretly learning forbidden martial arts—any one of these was a capital offense.

At this time, the monastery was already in turmoil over a case where a brawl between orthodox and secular monks had resulted in a death. At this critical juncture, Bu Gui, with his dual status as both orthodox and secular, had killed a fellow disciple, striking a sensitive nerve within the monastery and threatening to elevate the matter to the level of the orthodox-secular conflict.

Ming Buxiang visited Bu Gui in his cell once. He didn't ask anything, and Bu Gui couldn't say anything. The two sat in silence, Bu Gui just staring at Ming Buxiang's face.

'Junior Brother Ming's face is still so handsome, much more handsome than Lü Changfeng's,' Bu Gui thought. From their very first meeting, he had been captivated by Ming Buxiang's appearance. 'If I am born with this face in my next life, I should have many friends too.'

Before Ming Buxiang left, Bu Gui said, "Thank you, my friend. I will repay what I owe you in my next life."

Ming Buxiang nodded and left without looking back.

The verdict from the Hall of Upright Action came down quickly.

Immediate execution.

The death penalty in Shaolin Monastery was not beheading. In accordance with the Buddhist spirit of compassion, they chose a more painless method of execution. The condemned was bound and made to kneel while the executioner stood behind them. The executioner had to be a monk who had mastered a fierce finger technique of the Dragon's Claw or higher. These monks were mostly secular monks. They would use their finger strength to shatter the Feishu and Xinshu acupoints on the victim's back. With one strike, the victim's heart and lungs would be instantly crushed, resulting in a silent, painless death.

The martial art used by the executioner today was the very one Bu Gui knew, the one he had used to kill Lü Changfeng—the Dragon's Claw.

Bu Gui knelt on the execution ground, looking around. He did not see Ming Buxiang.

'This must be karmic retribution,' Bu Gui thought, closing his eyes. He suddenly remembered the story Abbot Jueming had told, the one he liked so much, the story of Kandata and the spider.

'Perhaps that spider's thread was not meant to save Kandata,' Bu Gui thought. 'It was only there to make him fall harder, and from a greater height...'

He felt a sharp pain in his back, which spread to his chest. Before it could register throughout his body, his consciousness had already begun to dissipate, and a heavy wave of drowsiness washed over him.

After Bu Gui's death, Ming Buxiang requested to be solely responsible for cleaning the Repository of Divine Arts. Everyone thought it was his way of remembering Bu Gui and agreed.

Another senior brother became the new work detail leader. The cleaning in the Hall of True Insight returned to its usual state—windows bright, floors clean, everything neat and orderly. Every disciple was sincere and diligent, and no one slacked off again.

But they never went on outings together anymore, and there was much less interaction among them.

They each carried a heavy sense of guilt.

Like the hump on Bu Gui's back.
