# Chapter 5: A Peach Blossom's Flight

Kunlun Year 83, spring, the fourth month.

On the third day of the fourth month, five days before Buddha's Birthday, the inns of the Buddha Capital were long since full, and pilgrims unable to find lodging had taken to renting rooms in private residences. For the next seven days, the Buddha Capital would be ablaze with lights as bright as day, bustling with noise until dawn. Street vendors and shops operated day and night, and customers streamed in endlessly in a magnificent, lively scene.

He Dasong had lived on the outskirts of the Buddha Capital since he was a child. His father farmed a few acres of barren land, while his mother earned a little extra money mending monks' robes at home. He Dasong began helping his father with farm work at the age of seven, and for this reason, his gaunt body had grown sturdy. He had two younger brothers and a sister below him.

A heavy snow in his seventh year took his youngest brother, who had just been born, and his mother never gave birth again after that. With five mouths to feed, the remaining family of five already had it hard enough. If there was any surplus, it would be gone by the time they paid the land tax and the annual lamp oil donation—that was Shaolin's poll tax, which signified that Shaolin lit blessing lamps for every citizen to protect the people under its care—and they were usually still in debt. He Dasong always wanted to eat less so his brother could have his fill, but his mother would say he needed strength for his work.

The cost of living in the Buddha Capital was high, and life was hard. From sunrise to sunset, the work was always the same. Only during the Buddha's Birthday festival each year would his parents take him into the city to worship. There were many beautiful things to see there: solemn statues of the Buddha, magnificent manors, street performers singing and storytelling, and the fragrant aroma of food wafting from teahouses and restaurants.

But none of it belonged to him.

The thing he wanted most was just a skewer of candied hawthorns. That was the only extra gift he could possibly receive.

In his eighth year, he finally worked up the courage to ask the price of the candied hawthorns.

One skewer cost five copper coins.

He thought that when he came back to the Buddha Capital next year, he would save up those five coins.

But he truly couldn't even save a single coin. His days were filled with fetching water, chopping firewood, gathering dry branches, chasing away pests, threshing grain, and looking after his younger siblings, and he still had to squeeze in some time to learn a few characters. 

Even if he had free time, he didn't know where he could go to earn money. When his ninth year arrived, he still went to the Buddha Capital empty-handed, secretly salivating as he watched the candied hawthorn vendor.

In his tenth year, he carried firewood for a wealthy household in the Buddha Capital. Each load earned him a reward of ten copper coins, every single one of which had to be given to his parents. One day, the master of the house had a son. He Dasong delivered firewood as usual, and the gate guard asked, "How many people are in your family?"

"Five. Three big and two small," He Dasong said, counting himself among the big ones.

The guard nodded, took out five pastries, and said, "The master has just had a son, so there's a reward for everyone who comes to the door. Take these five celebratory cakes."

He Dasong said, "Just give me four. Can I trade the other one for money?"

The guard asked in puzzlement, "How much do you want for it?"

He Dasong said, "Five copper coins will be enough."

The guard roared with laughter. "You don't know what you're missing. This cake is worth at least twenty coins, yet you only ask for five. Alright, I'll go ask for you."

The guard went inside and, after a while, returned with four boxes of cakes and five copper coins for He Dasong. "The master says to reward you with five copper coins."

Back at home, He Dasong claimed he had eaten his cake on the way, and his family didn't doubt him. That night, the He family's dinner was those four cakes. He Dasong went hungry for the night.

He sewed the five copper coins into the lining of his clothes, waiting for the next year's Buddha's Birthday.

The following year, on the day of Buddha's Birthday, he took his younger siblings to the candied hawthorn stall while his parents were offering incense and worshipping.

He saw the way his younger brother and sister drooled while staring at the candied hawthorns, and he didn't forget to remind them, "Remember not to tell Mom and Dad, or your big brother will get a beating."

His siblings nodded eagerly.

"One skewer of candied hawthorns," He Dasong said, handing his money to the vendor. The vendor frowned and said, "It's not enough."

He Dasong was startled and asked, "What do you mean, not enough? Isn't it five coins a skewer?"

"That was last year's price. Now it's six coins a skewer," the vendor said. "You're still one coin short."

He Dasong stammered, "I only have five coins."

He looked at the candied hawthorns—there were three on a skewer—and asked, "Just sell me two. Is that alright? My little brother and sister want to eat some."

The vendor shook his head. "I can't do that. They're already skewered. Who would I sell the last one to?"

He Dasong pleaded again and again before the vendor finally said, "Alright, just two then."

He pulled one of the hawthorns off, slid it onto another bamboo skewer, and handed the remaining two to He Dasong.

He Dasong said to his younger siblings, "One each, no fighting."

His younger brother asked, "Aren't you having any, big brother?"

He Dasong shook his head. He looked at the candied hawthorns and couldn't help but add, "Big brother will just have two licks."

He put a candied hawthorn in his mouth and felt only a cool, gentle sweetness. It was incredibly delicious, simply the most exquisite delicacy in the world. He couldn't help but squint his eyes, his face breaking into a wide smile. Fearing he would swallow it by accident, he quickly handed it back to his little brother and said, "Alright, you two can eat now."

Watching his brother and sister happily share the treat made him happy as well.

'At least I got a lick,' He Dasong thought. 'I'll come back again next year.'

With his brother in one hand and his sister in the other, he wandered around the area. After a few laps, he figured it was about time to go back to the ceremony grounds to find their parents, so he said, "Let's go."

Just as he turned back, he unexpectedly bumped into a girl. The girl let out a small cry as a skewer of something fell from her hand.

A young man stood beside the girl and cursed, "Damn it, are you blind?"

He Dasong looked again at the girl. She had two long braids and a lovely red face, round and very pretty. He couldn't help but stare, dumbfounded.

The girl quickly said, "It's alright, it's alright." She knelt to pick up what she had dropped: a skewer of candied hawthorns.

It was a four-piece skewer of candied hawthorns. Wasn't it the very one that would have made up for the piece he couldn't buy earlier?

The young man said, "It's all dirty. Throw it away."

He Dasong quickly said, "Don't waste it. Give it to me."

The young man cursed, "Get lost!"

The girl said, "Brother Lang, don't be so harsh with him."

She hesitated for a moment, then wiped the dust off the candied hawthorns with a silk handkerchief and handed it to He Dasong, saying, "Here."

He Dasong took the skewer of candied hawthorns, a full four-piece skewer. He was so happy he could have flown to the heavens. He hurriedly said to the girl, "Thank you! Thank you!"

The young lady's face flushed red, and she quickly walked away. He gazed at her departing back as if in a daze.

After that year, he had something new to look forward to—every Buddha's Birthday, he would search for that young lady's figure, and every year, he was able to see her. The young lady was a devout believer and would go before the Buddha's bone relic every Buddha's Birthday to receive a monk's blessing. As long as he waited there, he could always catch a glimpse of her.

But unlike the candied hawthorns, which were a small happiness he could obtain through hard work, that young lady was like the high walls and deep courtyards of the wealthy master's estate. It was a world that did not belong to him.

'Just seeing her this once is enough,' he thought.

Two years later, someone took a fancy to their family's farmland, wanting to buy it to grow tea. They received a small sum of money and considered leaving the Buddha Capital to find a new life elsewhere. But moving a family of five from their hometown would be expensive, and fearing they wouldn't have enough for the journey, his parents considered selling his younger sister into servitude as a maid.

He Dasong told his parents he would voluntarily enter a temple and become a monk to lessen the family's burden. He became a disciple of the orthodox monk Liaoxu and, keeping part of his name, was given the dharma name Bensong. Liaoxu was a Proctor Monk who had not yet entered a Hall and lived in the Nameless Temple within the Buddha Capital.

After that, his life was one of morning bells and evening drums, of chanting sutras in the morning and at night. He didn't know if he did it for his sister or so he could stay in the Buddha Capital and see the young lady once a year.

Two more years passed, and he heard from his master that Monk Liaoxin had brought back a simple-minded child. Occasionally, when Liaoxin was away on business, he would entrust the child to his master's care. He remembered the child's name was Ming Buxiang, and he was an exceptionally well-behaved boy.

Ming Buxiang gradually grew up, and naturally, the girl did as well. He also slowly grew from that ten-year-old child into a young man.

The girl also became a young lady, blossoming with elegance and grace.

He still searched for the young lady's figure every year at Buddha's Birthday, and every year he was not disappointed.

No conversation, no getting closer.

Just a stolen glance from afar.

At eighteen, Master Liaoxin entered a Hall, and Ming Buxiang left the Buddha Capital.

At nineteen, he saw the young lady with her hair pinned up in a bun and knew she was married.

After the Buddha's Birthday that year, he fell gravely ill and nearly died. Once recovered, he did nothing but chant sutras.

At twenty, Liaoxu passed away from illness in the Nameless Temple, never having entered a Hall in his entire life.

At twenty-six, he passed the martial trial and obtained a Writ of Chivalry. Juejian assigned him to be a Proctor Monk in Hebei, but he insisted on staying in the Buddha Capital to take over his master Liaoxu's duties.

Every Buddha's Birthday, he served as an incense monk, standing guard before the Buddha's bone relic, burning incense and praying for the devotees. The believers were numerous, and there were more than twenty incense monks like him. He would glance left and right, and he could always find the young lady's figure in the line before him.

At this time, she was already a young wife. She followed the long line to stand before him, her hands pressed together, bowing her head in reverence.

"Amitabha." He chanted the Buddha's name, his right hand tracing a circle above the young wife's head, almost touching her jet-black hair. But he did not overstep, blessing her with a piety he had never felt before.

Every Buddha's Birthday, the inns were certain to be full. Many people came with their entire families on pilgrimage. To accommodate the pilgrims, the Nameless Temple would give up its monks' quarters for them to stay in, and the monks would move into the inns.

Bensong's old residence was given to a family of six, and he himself moved into the Universal Light Inn in the Buddha Capital. It was an ordinary-sized inn with a row of peach trees planted in the backyard. At night, from his second-floor room, he looked down and saw that very row of peach trees.

He unexpectedly saw a familiar figure standing under the peach trees, gazing quietly at them in the soft moonlight. The moon's reflection and the peach blossoms complemented each other, making her appear exceptionally captivating.

He was surprised and moved; he had seen her one more time than in previous years.

He just sat quietly by the windowsill, having extinguished the candle, and watched her figure until her husband called her inside.

He had never seen her husband. A sense of curiosity arose in him, but he ultimately restrained himself from peeking.

This was enough. To know more was to have more worries. He picked up a scripture and recited it silently, but he couldn't stop the distracting thoughts from swarming his mind.

In his twenty-seventh year, just like the years before, he coincidentally blessed her again, coincidentally stayed in the same inn, and watched her figure under the same moonlight.

In his twenty-eighth year, it was the same.

If, for all the years and months to come, I know you are well, this life will be enough.

But, if I learn you are not well, what then?

This year, on this day, Bensong was twenty-nine. It was the fourth day of the fourth month, four days before Buddha's Birthday.

"Junior Brother Ming?" Bensong looked at the young man before him in surprise. "You've come to the Buddha Capital too?"

Ming Buxiang said, "First Seat Jueming sent me to help."

This was the first time Ming Buxiang had been sent to participate in the Buddha's Birthday festival. When Liaoxin was around, he always had duties during the festival and would leave Ming Buxiang at the temple. After Liaoxin was gone, Ming Buxiang's status was low, and he was only responsible for sweeping within the temple. He was not assigned to receive esteemed guests, nor was he needed for work in the Buddha Capital. It wasn't until this year that Jueming, wanting him to gain experience, specially sent him to help.

Bensong smiled and said, "You surely don't remember me."

"You are Senior Brother Bensong, disciple of Martial Uncle Liaoxu."

Bensong said in surprise, "That was ten years ago. You were only... four, I think? Every time Martial Uncle Liaoxin went on a long trip, he had me look after you."

"Thank you for your hard work, Senior Brother."

"It was no trouble at all. you were exceptionally good, never crying or making a fuss. Ai, I can't believe you still remember me. What have you been assigned to do?"

"I am a lay disciple receptionist, here to guide the pilgrims."

Bensong nodded. "I see, that's hard work. Where are you sleeping tonight? Back at the temple?"

"I'm temporarily staying at the Universal Light Inn."

Bensong said happily, "That's the same inn as me! We'll have to have a good chat when we have time."

"Damn it, chitchatting here, can't you see everyone else is working?" A slender, middle-aged monk leading several younger monks approached. Bensong recognized him as Benyue's master, Liaowu. They were responsible for protecting the Buddha's bone relic.

Besides them, the Abbot of the Hall of True Vocation, Jueji, nicknamed the _Brocade Lion,_ was also stationed here, currently in the rear hall.

Liaowu cursed, "Everyone's working, and you two are just standing around? Are orthodox monks so great that they can leave all the work to the secular monks while they just eat and sleep?"

Bensong quickly said, "Martial Uncle Liaowu, please calm your anger. It was this disciple who pulled Junior Brother Ming aside to chat. I'll get back to work right away."

He pulled Ming Buxiang to leave, but Liaowu shouted, "Ming Buxiang, get over here!"

Ming Buxiang stopped and turned to look at Liaowu. Bensong quickly tried to smooth things over but was cut off by Liaowu's shout, "I wasn't talking to you!"

Bensong was rebuked and, constrained by his status, did not dare say more. Liaowu looked Ming Buxiang up and down and said, "Just as handsome as they say. Truly a monster!"

Ming Buxiang was merely silent. Liaowu asked again, "Why don't you speak?"

Ming Buxiang said, "This disciple is a monster. I fear that if I open my mouth, I will only speak monstrous words to mislead the masses."

Liaowu sneered, "Don't think you can get away with anything just because the two abbots, Juejian and Jueming, dote on you! Two abbots can't compare to one first seat! I'm watching you, so don't you dare make a mistake, or you'll see what happens!" With that, he led his disciples away.

Bensong said, "Junior Brother Ming, don't take it to heart. His disciple went mad, so he's just looking to vent his anger on you."

Ming Buxiang said lightly, "It's alright."

The matter of changing the secular monks' names, discussed in the Four Courts' joint council, had gradually spread. Of the Four Courts and Eight Halls, with their seven orthodox and five secular divisions, the orthodox monks held the majority.

It was said that even the two abbots who had opposed the name change, Juejian and Jueming, had begun to waver. After Buddha's Birthday, the Four Courts would convene again, at which point the renaming of the secular monks would be all but certain.

At this moment, Shaolin Temple was in a state of turmoil. The secular monks, believing that most of Shaolin's affairs had long relied on them, were deeply dissatisfied at being treated as second-class monks. The orthodox monks, however, felt that the secular monks had tarnished their pure reputation and implicated them, and that justice was finally being served.

The two factions were now like fire and water. Every meeting was filled with mutual sarcasm and incessant conflict. Although there had been no brawls or loss of life, the friction was intensifying, lacking only a spark to ignite it.

That evening, Ming Buxiang checked into the Universal Light Inn. It was his first time staying at an inn. Although the Universal Light was not a high-class inn, it was much more comfortable than his quarters at Shaolin Temple. Ming Buxiang lit a candle, felt the quilt, and pushed open the window. Beneath the moonlight, the branches and leaves of the peach trees swayed gracefully.

He left his room, walked into the backyard, and looked up to see that the window of the adjacent room, where Bensong was staying, was ajar. The figure behind the window was looking in his direction but didn't greet him, seeming to be lost in thought.

Ming Buxiang thought for a moment, then gazed into the distance toward Shaolin Temple.

※ ※ ※

At that moment in Shaolin Temple, most of the disciples had gone to the Buddha Capital to help with the Buddha's Birthday festival. Liaojing took advantage of the night to walk from the Unique Wisdom Court to the Hall of Upright Action in the Universal Virtue Court. He scaled the courtyard wall, avoided the patrolling monks, and arrived outside Ming Buxiang's room.

Liaojing knew Ming Buxiang lived alone and had no roommate. He saw that the door was unlocked and was about to push it open, but after a moment's thought, he circled around to the back window. After confirming the room was empty, he pushed open the window and entered.

The reason he went around to the window was the fear that Ming Buxiang had set a trap on the door that would alert him to an intruder. However, upon later inspection of the door and window, he found no sign of any contraption.

Ming Buxiang's room was spotless, a world apart from his own.

'What a perfect little doll,' Liaojing thought.

He searched carefully. The room contained nothing but scriptures. Inside the wardrobe were only two worn, unlined robes and two sets of undergarments. He looked under the bed; even the floor there was clean, without a speck of dust. He pulled out the desk drawer. Inside were only miscellaneous items like a needle and thread, small scissors, a small brush, an inkstone, and an ink stick.

Could it be that he was overthinking things? Thinking about it carefully, what could a fifteen-year-old boy hope to gain with such schemes? Status in the temple, or some other benefit?

Just as he was about to push the drawer back in, a thought struck him.

'He has a brush, ink, and an inkstone in his drawer, so why is there no paper?'

Monks were not allowed to make notes in the scriptures borrowed from the scripture repository. He looked around again, confirmed there was no paper in the room, and then, after a moment, he pulled the entire drawer out. Holding the candle up to look into the compartment, he was shocked to see a journal. He hastily took it out and, fearing the lamp oil would stain it, placed the candle on the edge of the bed and began to read by its light.

It was Ming Buxiang's journal. Unexpectedly, Ming Buxiang's handwriting was wild and unrestrained, often missing strokes.

Liaojing thought, 'So this kid isn't so flawless after all.'

He read through it carefully, and the more he read, the more horrified he became, a cold sweat breaking out on his skin.

It recorded how Ming Buxiang had secretly plotted, observed, and lured Bu Gui; how Fu Yingcong had come to offer his goodwill, only to be seen through; how he had subsequently tricked Fu Yingcong into taking the aphrodisiac he himself had brought, sending him to the place agreed upon with Benyue; how Benyue had indulged his lust and bullied Fu Yingcong; and how he himself, during Fu Yingcong's breakdown and daze, had provoked him and induced his suicide. It also detailed how, on the snowy mountain, he forced Yao Yunda and the other to fight, observing their changes, and finally, how he had used the Flower-Plucking Finger Art to impersonate a ghost and drive Benyue insane.

Liaojing's scalp tingled as he read. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed such a horrifying thing could exist in the world.

The demon king Mara. That was the first thought that entered his mind. If such a monster truly existed in this world, it must be the demon king Mara descended to earth to destroy Buddhism!

But no matter how hard it was to believe, with this journal, he could expose Ming Buxiang's venomous mind. Liaojing tucked the journal into his robes and pushed the drawer back into place.

This trip had been immensely fruitful, and Liaojing should have been thoroughly satisfied, but for some reason, he felt a sense of unease. He then went to the room next door—Liaoxin's room.

Liaoxin's room, like Ming Buxiang's, had been swept spotlessly clean. Even in Liaoxin's absence, Ming Buxiang had not slacked in the slightest. He searched the room carefully and found a thick stack of diaries tied with a rope under the bed.

He untied the rope. Besides Liaoxin's own cultivation notes, the diaries were filled with records about Ming Buxiang, the affection clear on every page. Liaojing thought that reading through them one by one would take until dawn.

He flipped backward from the last volume and saw that the last few days' entries read: "Lately, my mind has been weary and my thoughts scattered. Plagued by external demons, I find it difficult to control myself. My cultivation is insufficient, leading me into desires from which I cannot escape. I must uphold the precepts, chant the sutras, and advance my practice."

Liaojing thought, 'How did Liaoxin also become like this?'

He flipped back further and found more entries about being beset by inner demons and words of self-admonition and vigilance. He flipped back to the day Ming Buxiang presented the longevity peach bun. It was written: "Xiang'er presented a longevity peach bun to wish me a long life, and my heart is comforted. More than a decade has passed in a flash. I am glad Xiang'er is intelligent and possesses deep Buddhist wisdom; his future is limitless. Today, for Xiang'er, I have broken thirty years of my pure precepts. Though I have no regrets, my heart is filled with guilt. Cultivation is truly a difficult path; once a thought arises, it never ceases."

He flipped back a few more pages, which were mostly about miscellaneous matters. He had a lazy disposition, and his actions today were already more diligent than he had ever been in the past. Since he had found the evidence, he didn't linger.

Just then, he suddenly heard the front door open. Liaojing's heart skipped a beat. He quickly blew out the candle, focused his hearing, and heard soft footsteps. He guessed it was Ming Buxiang returning. He hastily tied the diaries back up, all the while racking his brain, wondering if he had left any traces in Ming Buxiang's room.

He heard the sound of Ming Buxiang opening a window. If he jumped out the window now, he would surely be spotted by Ming Buxiang next door. Liaojing pushed Liaoxin's diaries back to their original spot under the bed and gently swept up the surrounding dust, striving to leave it spotless. For what he couldn't sweep clean, Liaojing circulated his internal energy, took a deep breath, and blew the dust away, all while paying attention to the movements outside.

He heard Ming Buxiang's footsteps approaching his location. In the dead of night, the slightest sound would attract attention. He moved lightly, rolling under the bed.

With a creak, the door was pushed open. From under the bed, he could see only a pair of feet in the faint candlelight. It was Ming Buxiang, holding a candle as he entered.

'Has he discovered the journal is missing?' Liaojing held his breath, thinking, 'If he discovers me now and we fight, will I be Lü Changfeng, getting my head twisted off with one swipe, or will I be Bu Gui, getting poked with dozens of holes by his Flower-Plucking Finger Art?'

Although he was more than ten years older than Ming Buxiang and one of the top figures of the 'Liao' generation, Ming Buxiang was truly a monster. Without absolute certainty, it was better not to take the risk.

The room was dim, illuminated only by the candle in Ming Buxiang's hand. The enemy was in the light while he was in the dark. If he launched a surprise attack, it wasn't impossible to escape, and he might even succeed in killing this monster with a single strike.

But now that he had evidence in hand, why risk a direct confrontation?

While his thoughts raced and he wavered, Ming Buxiang slowly turned, walked out of the room, and closed the door. A moment later, he heard the sound of the front door opening and closing. Ming Buxiang seemed to have gone far away.

Liaojing let out a long sigh of relief, rolled out from under the bed, felt the journal in his robes, and slipped away through the window.

That night, Liaojing lay in bed, contemplating how to handle the journal. Logically, he should give it to the Abbot of the Hall of Upright Action, Juejian, or the Abbot of the Hall of True Insight, Jueming, who had allowed Ming Buxiang to enter a Hall. But both martial uncles were partial to Ming Buxiang. This journal might not be enough to convict him and would likely only stir up more trouble.

'I'll have to give it to Master,' Liaojing thought.

Although he could finally eliminate this scourge, Liaojing still felt a trace of unease in his heart. He was a perceptive person and knew that this so-called unease was actually his intuition telling him something was amiss, but he just hadn't figured out what the problem was yet.

Because of this small bit of unease, Liaojing did not go to find Abbot Jueru first thing the next morning. He knew Ming Buxiang was staying in the Buddha Capital and waited until after the evening meal before going to see Jueru.

"It's not my birthday, so why are you here again?" Jueru asked. "If you're too idle, the Buddha Capital is quite lively right now."

"I just missed Master and wanted to be close to you," Liaojing said. "We master and disciple see so little of each other. Since we have a rare chance to meet, this disciple also wants to show some filial piety."

"Ah, everything about Shaolin Temple is great, except that the Unique Wisdom and Universal Virtue Courts are too far apart. It takes a year and a half to walk from one to the other," Jueru joked, then asked, "What do you want to eat?"

"Are there any of those osmanthus chestnut cakes from last time left?" Liaojing asked.

"They went moldy long ago," Jueru said. "Someone sent over some loquats. Want some?"

"Sure. Everything Master has here is good. I'll eat whatever you have," Liaojing said.

Jueru took a bag of loquats from a cabinet and said, "Since you respect your master so much, why not come back and follow me? You'll have good fruit to eat every day, and you can learn some more techniques while you're at it. I guarantee you'll make rapid progress."

Liaojing pondered for a long while. "Learning techniques..."

"What's wrong? Have your eye on some high-level martial art?"

Liaojing asked, "If someone mastered the Flower-Plucking Finger Art at fifteen, what kind of level would that be?"

Jueru roared with laughter, "Are you joking? Fifteen? Someone with poor aptitude couldn't master it even at fifty!"

"Just saying. If there were such a genius, how incredible would that be?"

Jueru said, "That is Abbot Jueming's specialty. He achieved initial mastery of the Flower-Plucking Finger Art in his twenty-eighth year. According to the temple records, the fastest anyone ever mastered it was at twenty-three. Fifteen... that would have to be a reincarnation of Bodhidharma."

Liaojing said, "Or perhaps a reincarnation of Papiyas."

Jueru replied, "I don't know if Papiyas has been reincarnated, but there are certainly plenty of his disciples in the temple."

Liaojing knew his master was talking about the secular monks. On this point, he didn't agree with his master's thinking. In his view, if you want to cultivate, then cultivate on your own. Everyone was working hard for Shaolin, so the conflict between orthodox and secular was truly unnecessary.

Jueru asked, "Why do you ask about this?"

Liaojing said, "Nothing, just asking. I wonder if there's any martial art that specifically counters this Flower-Plucking Finger Art?"

Jueru said, "There's nothing that specifically counters it, but if we're talking about breaking it down based on its moves and characteristics, the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art, which uses softness as its foundation and hardness as its application, can block the formless finger energy of the Flower-Plucking Finger Art. It would be the best choice. Do you want to learn it? I can write you a permission slip."

Liaojing quickly waved his hands. "No, no. I'm too lazy."

"If you weren't so lazy, you might have become an abbot before you turned forty. You could have brought me some glory and let your master bask in the limelight for a bit."

Liaojing smiled and said, "Master, you are an orthodox monk. It is not right for you to be so burdened by vanity!"

"Are you lecturing me now?" Jueru's face hardened as he scolded, "Turn around and let your master kick your butt a couple of times!"

Liaojing feigned shock. "Master, you mustn't! When did you pick up such a wicked habit of randomly smacking people's behinds?"

Jueru burst out laughing again. "Even if someone truly mastered the Flower-Plucking Finger Art at fifteen, without sufficient internal energy, their power would be limited. To master any of the seventy-two ultimate arts of Shaolin, one must have a profound internal energy as a foundation. Only the successive abbots of the Four Courts and Eight Halls can cultivate the Yijin Jing. Both the original and duplicate copies are kept in the Great Hall of Heroes, personally stored by the Abbot. As for the Xisui Jing, you know, when the King of Wrath rebelled, the temple was caught in the flames of war, and the duplicate copy of the Xisui Jing was lost. Although the original remains, it has been eaten by insects and ants over the years, and much of the text is missing. Forcing oneself to practice it would certainly lead to qi deviation. It's stored in the Repository of Divine Arts for viewing only."

Liaojing asked doubtfully, "They are both said to be two great divine arts, so how is it that over these past decades, quite a few people have learned the Yijin Jing, but not even a handful of people who have learned the Xisui Jing are mentioned in the records?"

"Truly, not many at all. It's said that when these two internal arts are cultivated to a deep level, they are evenly matched. But the Yijin Jing is easy to start and difficult to master. Even after practicing for twenty, thirty, or even forty or fifty years, reaching the level of First Seat Juekong isn't considered the end."

First Seat Juekong was not only the head of the secular monks, but in terms of martial arts, he was also Shaolin's number one. Before Qi Zigai, Third Master Qi of Kongtong, rose to fame, he was even considered by most in the martial world to be the best under heaven. But in this day and age, being the best under heaven was no longer of any consequence. No one competed for it, and no one cared. It was just treated as a term of flattery.

"The Xisui Jing is different. It is easy to master but difficult to learn. Once you get started, progress in the initial stages is incredibly rapid. But many people have spent thirty or fifty years without even getting past the entryway, wasting their time for nothing. Their results are even worse than the initial stages of the Yijin Jing. If it were you, would you practice the Yijin Jing or the Xisui Jing?"

Liaojing asked doubtfully, "Among the many eminent monks and great masters in the temple over the past several hundred years, surely there were some with exceptional wisdom and intelligence. Has no one mastered it?"

"It is said that the Xisui Jing is missing its introductory cultivation method. Some also say that the Xisui Jing was never completed. Others even claim that the version stored in the temple now is a fake, and that the original was destroyed over two hundred years ago when the previous dynasty's emperor suppressed Buddhism," Jueru said. "However, I've heard that someone managed to master it over a hundred years ago, dispelling those rumors and proving that the Xisui Jing can truly be cultivated."

"Who?" Liaojing asked.

"I don't know," Jueru replied.

Liaojing grew curious again. "How can you not know?"

"The temple has a record of this person, but it just doesn't mention his name. Strange, isn't it?" Jueru said. "In any case, don't dream of reaching heaven in a single step. When any martial art is cultivated to a high level, they all become similar—not just in power, but also in the difficulty of progressing further. They say the Yijin Jing is easy to learn and hard to master, but there have been many who achieved great success in less than ten years. They say the Xisui Jing is hard to learn and easy to master, but once you reach my level, your Master's, further advancement still depends on talent and opportunity. Otherwise, everyone would just practice the Xisui Jing. What would be the point of practicing the Yijin Jing?"

Liaojing had been beating around the bush for a long time, never getting to the point, because he was still trying to figure out what was wrong. At this point, he had to ask. "Master, what do you think of... Ming Buxiang as a person?"

"Why bring him up again?" Jueru looked Liaojing up and down. "And you're asking what Master thinks of him? Could it be... what are you planning to do? If you want Master to approve your marriage, you should at least return to secular life and find a proper girl first."

Liaojing didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Master, I'm asking seriously."

Jueru said, "I'm being serious too. I never thought you'd be corrupted by the secular monks, getting into this ambiguous business. It truly pains your master's heart, truly pains me."

"I learned it from you, didn't I?" Liaojing threw up his hands. "You just told me to turn around so you could smack my butt."

The master and disciple burst into laughter.

Jueru said, "Speaking seriously, Ming Buxiang is quite a talent. Never mind Abbots Jueming and Juejian; even First Seat Jueguan now praises him highly. He is handsome, like a figure carved from jade, humble, intelligent, diligent, and possesses a photographic memory. To this day, he still cherishes the memory of his master, Liaoxin, and lives in his old residence in the Hall of Upright Action. Strange, how come I can't get such a good disciple?"

When Jueru mentioned a photographic memory, Liaojing’s heart skipped a beat. Ming Buxiang had no paper in his room because he possessed a photographic memory and had no need for notes. If that was the case, why prepare an inkstone and brush, unless it was specifically to record his own crimes? Would he forget them himself? And if he wouldn't forget, why write them down at all?

He turned his back on Jueru and took out the notebook he had acquired the previous night. The daylight was bright now, and the script on the page was clear. Liaojing examined it closely and found the handwriting familiar. Upon closer inspection, wasn't it his own? Ming Buxiang had imitated his script to write this book. If he were to foolishly submit it, he would be sealing his own guilt for framing an innocent man—and in the most idiotic way possible.

Jueru saw him turn away and asked, “What are you doing? Are you really showing your master your backside?”

Liaojing quickly quipped, “I just wanted to see if Master’s virtue was consistent from all angles.” At the same time, he hastily put the notebook away.

Jueru raised his foot as if to kick him, scolding, “Nonsense! So strange and eccentric!” He then added, “You should learn from him instead of just relying on your intelligence and being lazy!”

Liaojing gave a wry smile. “Yes, Master. This disciple will change at once!”

Jueru asked, “How will you change?”

Liaojing said with a pained expression, “If you write an order now, this disciple will immediately go learn the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art.”

Jueru roared with laughter.

On the fifth day of the fourth month, three days before Buddha's Birthday, Bensong once again saw her figure at the ceremony before the Buddha’s bone relic. Whether by fate or by chance, she was lined up in his queue as always, and Bensong felt a great sense of comfort.

He had waited an entire year just for these few days of meeting. Seeing her for these few days alone was enough to soothe a year of longing.

When there were only a dozen or so people left, Liaowu came over and whispered in Bensong’s ear, “We’re out of tea leaves. Abbot Jueji wants tea, so go to the Chan Wind Teahouse and buy some.”

Bensong said hastily, “But I’m in the middle of offering prayers and blessings for the pilgrims.”

Liaowu cursed in his ear, “Get going. Someone will cover for you. Now hurry up and stop dawdling!”

Bensong had wanted to refuse, but seeing Liaowu’s fierce expression, he had no choice but to bow to the pilgrims and say, “This humble monk has an urgent matter to attend to and will return shortly.”

With that, he departed at a quick pace.

Ming Buxiang was at the ceremony grounds, answering questions and giving directions to the lay disciples. He saw Bensong leave, and when he turned his head, he noticed that another monk had already taken Bensong’s place to offer blessings to the pilgrims.

Bensong was anxious, but the Buddha Capital was thronged with people. As he was a monk, running would be unseemly and attract attention, so he could only walk briskly. When he arrived at the Chan Wind Teahouse, it was packed with customers and bustling with activity. He hurried to get in line and had to wait for a full half-hour before it was his turn to buy the tea. With the tea in hand, he hurried back to the ceremony, knowing he was certainly too late. He first gave the tea leaves to Liaowu, then returned to his post to offer blessings to the pilgrims.

‘I missed her after all this year.’ He sighed to himself. ‘Well, she should still be staying at the Universal Light Inn tonight, right?’

He collected his thoughts and focused on offering blessings to the remaining pilgrims.

An hour later, he saw that familiar figure in the queue once more. She was still in line, moving forward in turn.

‘How can that be?’ Bensong was astonished. ‘Did she have to leave for some reason, just like me, and was forced to get back in line?’ As he thought this, he couldn't conceal his delight and broke into a smile, his gaze happening to meet Ming Buxiang’s.

Ming Buxiang returned a polite smile, as radiant and warm as a blooming peach blossom.

※ ※ ※

'Ming Buxiang already knows I suspect him,' Liaojing thought.

'When he returned to his room last night, he might have discovered me and was just hesitating whether to make a move.'

'That monster has seen my handwriting while helping Abbot Juejian review official documents in the Hall of True Insight. To think he could imitate it so perfectly—he’s practically capable of anything.'

'It has come to this; there is no longer any need for concealment. To be so sinister at only fifteen years of age... if he remains at Shaolin Temple, he will truly become an endless calamity.'

'But how to eliminate this monster was the difficult part.'

Liaojing looked at the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art manual in his hands.

'How many days will this take to master…'

'If I make a move now, he’s only fifteen. I’m a full twelve years older than him; logically, my internal energy should be far more profound.'

'However, that monster defied logic.'

He thought of his seventh martial brother.

His seventh martial brother was gifted and had always been the best at martial arts among the martial brothers. It was said that their master had originally intended to take him on as a personal disciple. Of course, their master had said that to every one of his apprentices.

For the first three years after Liaojing joined the sect, the gap in skill between him and his seventh martial brother was vast. After another three years, that gap began to close, and three years after that, they were evenly matched. From then on, his seventh martial brother could never again catch up to him.

'I really should have been more diligent in my martial arts training,' Liaojing lamented.

'The gap in talent between myself and Ming Buxiang was likely even greater than the one between my seventh martial brother and me. In a few more years, I fear no one will be able to stop him.'

Making a move within the temple was not easy. The moment a fight broke out, someone would certainly intervene. Even if he succeeded, he would likely not escape with his life. He wanted to avoid that outcome if at all possible. The ideal result, of course, was to kill Ming Buxiang while also keeping his position as a cataloging monk, as if nothing had ever happened.

Of course, that would be rather difficult.

The best opportunity would be on Buddha's Birthday, a day of chaos in the Buddha Capital when Ming Buxiang would not be in the temple.

Preferably before the festivities for Buddha’s Birthday concluded.

He opened the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art manual.

'Three moves. I’ll master three moves first. I’ll use just these three to deal with Ming Buxiang and kill him when he least expects it.'

'Whether I can slay the demon will be up to the will of heaven.'

He rubbed his shaved head and sighed. “I used to think you were quite useful, but now I see how useless you really are.”

※ ※ ※

She finally arrived before Bensong again, bowing her head to let him offer his blessing.

Bensong chanted “Amitabha” and prayed for her, as always, with unusual piety.

Ming Buxiang walked over. The young woman looked up, and upon seeing Ming Buxiang, she froze for a moment.

Ming Buxiang smiled faintly and pressed his palms together in a respectful gesture.

The young woman returned the gesture and turned to leave.

“That poor woman,” Ming Buxiang said softly. Bensong heard him and turned back to ask, “What’s wrong?”

“Her husband beats her,” Ming Buxiang said, his face filled with endless pity.

Bensong’s heart jolted. “Don’t be ridiculous, she looks perfectly normal.”

Ming Buxiang said, “The wounds are on her back. He must be a disciple from a prominent family. To hide the shame, he only strikes her on the back and chest, where the marks won’t show and her demeanor remains unchanged.”

Bensong asked, “How do you know?”

Ming Buxiang replied, “When she bowed her head, I could see the bruises through the collar of her robes.”

Bensong said, “Perhaps she fell.”

Ming Buxiang shook his head. “I doubt it.”

Bensong stood there, stunned, momentarily forgetting his duties.

'As long as I know you are well, this life is enough.'

'But if you are not well, what should I do?'

As the sun set, Bensong returned to the inn, pushed open his window, and gazed at the peach tree below, waiting for that person to appear.

This year, however, was not as peaceful as years past.

After the evening meal, the beautiful woman indeed appeared again.

'Is she really being abused?'

Not long after, another person appeared. Bensong looked closely and saw it was Ming Buxiang.

Bensong’s heart leaped. He saw Ming Buxiang extend a finger and point in his direction. The beautiful woman looked up, her eyes meeting Bensong’s directly.

Bensong stared at the woman for a moment before closing the window.

The candlelight flickered, just like his turbulent heart.

A while later, a knock came at the door. Bensong opened it to find Ming Buxiang.

Ming Buxiang said, “I’m returning to Shaolin Temple to sleep tonight. Is there anything you need me to take back to the temple for you, Senior Brother?”

Bensong shook his head. “Nothing.” He then asked, “I saw you downstairs just now. What did you say to that lady?”

Ming Buxiang said, “I asked her if she knew you, Senior Brother.”

Bensong was suspicious. “Why would you ask that?”

Ming Buxiang replied, “This afternoon, when you were giving blessings, didn't you leave midway through? That lady saw you leave and gave her spot to an old woman, only getting back in line after you returned. I thought she must know you.”

Bensong was startled, remembering the afternoon’s events. He asked, “What did she say?”

Ming Buxiang said, “She said she knows you, but that you don’t know her, and that you haven’t sought her out to reminisce after all these years.”

Hearing this, Bensong’s heart was filled with shock and uncertainty.

Ming Buxiang added, “I came to the Buddha Capital this time hoping to find some old acquaintances from my childhood, but I never imagined that after only eleven years, it would be so hard to find anyone I know. Unless it’s at a familiar old place, I really don't know how we would ever meet.”

After speaking, Ming Buxiang left on his own. As he passed through the main hall downstairs, several monks from the Hall of Upright Action were eating. Ming Buxiang muttered to himself, “Such a beautiful woman, what could she be thinking about, standing under a peach tree?”

He made sure the monks from the Hall of Upright Action heard him; they were all Liaowu’s subordinates.

Bensong stood stunned in his room for a long while before heading downstairs and into the rear courtyard. He walked to the peach tree and stood beside the beautiful woman.

The person he had gazed at longingly for nineteen years.

After a long moment, the beautiful woman suddenly asked, “Were the candied hawthorns good?”

Bensong, surprised, turned to look at her.

The beautiful woman said, “That year, I begged Brother Lang to take me to buy candied hawthorns. I was standing right behind you and saw that because you were short one coin, you didn’t eat any yourself, but gave the two candied hawthorns to your younger brother and sister. So I bought that skewer of four and followed behind you, actually wanting to give it to you. But I was shy back then and afraid of hurting your pride, so I didn't know how to approach you. You turned around so suddenly and bumped right into me.”

She recounted the tale smoothly, as if speaking of a memory so distant it felt like a past life. To Bensong, that memory also felt a lifetime away.

“A year later, I saw you at the ceremony. I saw you every year after that for several years. I thought that by coming to this ceremony each year, I could at least see you once. But a few years later, I saw that you had become a monk.”

At this, the beautiful woman paused for a moment before continuing, “After that, I was married, and you became a blessing monk. I would line up in your queue, and knowing you stayed at this inn, I made a habit of staying here as well. You liked to look at the peach tree, so I stood beneath the peach tree. I thought of speaking to you several times, but I always figured you had long forgotten what happened more than a decade ago.”

'I don’t like looking at the peach tree; I like looking at the person beneath it,' Bensong thought, but he didn't say it aloud. Instead, he said, “I never forgot that day. I shared that skewer of candied hawthorns—one for my brother, one for my sister, and two for me. It was perfect.”

“It’s a pity they fell on the ground and got dirty,” the beautiful woman said softly.

“They weren’t dirty,” Bensong said. “That was the most unforgettable taste of my life.”

The two stood in silence for a long time. Bensong then said, “The night is late and the dew is heavy. Let’s go upstairs to talk.”

The beautiful woman nodded, and one after the other, they went upstairs. They carefully avoided the other monks, and Bensong led her to Ming Buxiang's room for no other reason than to avoid being disturbed.

They did not cross any boundaries, but simply sat and chatted casually with a pot of tea and a few plates of fruits and nuts, recounting their experiences over the past dozen years. Her name was Yuan Zhixuan, born to a wealthy family that was devoutly Buddhist. Bensong said his parents had moved away, leaving him alone in their old home. Yuan Zhixuan mentioned that Brother Lang was her cousin, a Wudang disciple who had received a Writ of Chivalry. He had taken good care of her when they were young but had since returned to Hubei to marry. Bensong spoke of how he studied martial arts at Shaolin Temple, how his master cared for him, and about Ming Buxiang, the one who had spoken to her earlier, who was thought to be a simpleton as a child but had unexpectedly grown up to be a prodigy.

They talked like this until dawn, when they grew tired, and only then did Yuan Zhixuan return to her room to sleep.

※ ※ ※

The sixth day of the fourth month, two days before Buddha’s Birthday.

Ming Buxiang returned to the ceremony to receive pilgrims. Bensong took a short nap during the noon break and asked Ming Buxiang where he would be sleeping that night. Ming Buxiang said he was returning to the temple, so Bensong asked no more.

That evening, Yuan Zhixuan came again, and the two began chatting about everything under the sun, as if they had endless things to say. They talked until midnight, when Bensong asked, “You came to Mount Shaoshi alone. Isn't your husband’s family worried?”

Yuan Zhixuan was silent for a long moment before saying, “He brought me up the mountain and then left. This place is full of Shaolin disciples, so nothing will happen. After Buddha's Birthday is over, he will come to take me back.”

Bensong hesitated for a moment, remembering what Ming Buxiang had said, and asked, “Is your husband good to you?”

Yuan Zhixuan gently closed her eyes, then slowly opened them again. She stood up, turned her back to Bensong, and untied her robes.

Bensong hastily turned his head away. Yuan Zhixuan exposed half of her back, and on her snow-white skin, a swath of bruises stretched from her neck down her back.

“He is a disciple from a prominent family. He loves to drink, and he hits me when he’s drunk. He hits me even when he’s not.”

Bensong glanced back and saw the bruises on her back. He felt a pang of heartache and pity, but he didn't know what to say.

Just as Yuan Zhixuan was about to put her clothes back on, the window suddenly creaked open and a masked man burst in. Bensong was shocked and quickly stepped forward. The man moved with extreme speed, his hand clamping around Bensong’s throat. Yuan Zhixuan was about to scream, but then she remembered she was meeting secretly with a monk and quickly covered her mouth.

The masked man looked at the two of them and cursed under his breath, “Why is it you two?”

Seeing Yuan Zhixuan’s disheveled clothes, he lowered his voice. “You’re actually carrying on an illicit affair here!”

Yuan Zhixuan knelt on the floor. “Mercy, great hero! We didn’t do anything! I seduced him, please let him go… it has nothing to do with him!”

The masked man found Yuan Zhixuan's words strange. He looked at her refined features, clearly those of a high-born lady, then looked at Bensong, who, while not ugly, had an ordinary face with nothing remarkable about it. It was more likely that Bensong had seduced her.

The masked man said, “You had better explain yourself clearly. Where is Ming Buxiang?”

Bensong’s face was flushed red, and he could barely breathe. He managed to say, “He… he went back to the temple…”

The masked man grunted and said, “What’s going on with you two? Explain it to me clearly.”

The two recounted their past history. Panicked, with their lives in another’s hands and afraid to call for help, they held nothing back, their feelings for each other laid bare.

After they finished, they looked at each other, their eyes filled with deep affection.

The masked man was Liaojing. He had originally intended to kill Ming Buxiang and had come after finding out his room number, only to stumble upon this scene. He was dumbfounded.

His first thought was, ‘Even someone who looks like Bensong can find a beautiful woman’s affection. How is it that a man of my caliber is surrounded only by my master and a bunch of monks?’

He fumed silently for a moment, realizing that Ming Buxiang had not returned to Shaolin and was likely watching from somewhere nearby. But why was Ming Buxiang manipulating these two? It certainly wasn't for a noble reason like bringing lovers together; he feared these two were in for a disaster.

He said, “Your six roots are impure; you have no business being a monk anymore. I can’t meddle in your affairs. Either run, or accept your fate. If you’re caught, you’ll both die.”

With that, he leaped back out the window, leaving the two bewildered people behind.

Liaojing landed on the roof, took off his mask, and looked around. The Buddha Capital was brightly lit, but there was no sign of Ming Buxiang.

Liaojing thought, 'Ming Buxiang is targeting these two for a reason. I really don't know how he plans to harm them.'

He stretched, deciding to just sleep on the roof.

'Maybe I should just leave monastic life. I might even be able to find a wife.' Then he thought again, 'Ah, but making a living is hard. Life as a cataloging monk in the scripture repository, reading books and practicing martial arts, is comfortable. It's not worth giving up for a wife, not worth it!'

The next morning, Liaojing woke up, rolled off the roof, and specifically found a mirror. He looked at his sharp brows and bright eyes, especially his impressively straight nose, and was quite pleased. 

He saw a female pilgrim pass by, stopped her, and asked, “Am I handsome?”

The pilgrim was startled, glanced at him once, and nodded quickly. “Handsome! Handsome!” She then hurried away.

Liaojing let out a laugh. He was about to face a life-or-death battle and was feeling tense; he used this bit of jest to calm his nerves.

The seventh day of the fourth month, the day before Buddha’s Birthday.

Bensong had been startled the night before and had not slept well. He pushed open his door to see Yuan Zhixuan already in the main hall.

He walked down, and Yuan Zhixuan came forward to meet him.

“My husband is coming to pick me up tomorrow morning. We will leave Shaolin after Buddha’s Birthday is over,” Yuan Zhixuan said faintly.

Bensong understood what she meant.

Nineteen years of longing. Would it now begin another cycle, or would something be different?

A few days ago, he certainly would not have agreed. She was married, and he had entered monastic life. To meet once a year was already a luxury.

But after Liaojing’s interruption yesterday, he finally understood his own heart.

“Pack your things. When the ceremony is over, we will leave,” Bensong said.

Yuan Zhixuan nodded, her expression firm.

Bensong found Ming Buxiang at the ceremony, wanting to tell him about last night’s events, but he didn't know how to explain why he was in his room. He could only say that it seemed someone was trying to harm him and that Ming Buxiang should be careful, suggesting it might be a monk in the temple who was jealous of him.

Ming Buxiang simply thanked him, seemingly unconcerned.

Bensong also thanked Ming Buxiang. Ming Buxiang didn't ask the reason for his thanks, and Bensong couldn't have explained it clearly anyway.

It was the longest ceremony of his life. Fortunately, Yuan Zhixuan understood his feelings and found a moment to catch his eye, just as they had done all those years, looking at each other from opposite ends of the venue, a single glance full of deep emotion.

With just that one look, Bensong felt at ease.

After the ceremony ended, Bensong and Yuan Zhixuan arranged to meet on a small path outside the Buddha Capital. At nightfall, they met and hurried down the mountain under the cover of darkness.

They hadn't gone half a mile when they saw several figures blocking the path ahead. Bensong’s face changed as he recognized Liaowu, who was followed by four Proctor Monks from the Hall of Upright Action.

Liaowu sneered, “Heh, I always thought orthodox monks were such virtuous gentlemen, tireless in their cultivation. Turns out they also seduce respectable women. What does the Kunlun council say? Those who rape or fornicate with women shall be executed by all under heaven.”

Bensong didn't know that from the moment he and Yuan Zhixuan met under the tree, Liaowu’s secular monks had been watching him. They knew everything about his clandestine meetings with Yuan Zhixuan but had deliberately waited until today to make their move.

“Those orthodox monks say we disgrace the name of Buddhism. Today, we’re going to parade you through the streets on Buddha’s Birthday and see who is truly disgracing the name of Buddhism,” Liaowu shouted. “Seize them!”

The four Proctor Monks swarmed forward. Not only was Bensong’s martial skill mediocre, but he was also outnumbered four to one. He was pinned to the ground shortly after the fight began. Yuan Zhixuan was helpless, crying as she threw herself forward. Fearing she would be caught by the fists and feet, Bensong rolled over and held her, shielding her with his body. The four monks rained down punches and kicks, and in a short while, Bensong was covered in injuries, spitting up blood that sprayed all over Yuan Zhixuan’s fine clothes. All she could do was hold Bensong and scream wildly, completely powerless.

Liaowu said, “It doesn't matter if the man is beaten to death. Seize the woman; we still need a confession.”

Just as Bensong was about to be beaten to death, a whistling sound cut through the air as a masked figure flew toward them. It was Liaojing. He had suspected that Ming Buxiang would move against these two and had been secretly following them. Now, his suspicions were confirmed, and he immediately intervened.

Though even he did not know if what he was doing was right or wrong.

His palms weaved through the air in a blur, a flower-weaving pattern moving from left to right. The four Proctor Monks were dazzled, feeling as if they were lost in a fog, and were struck repeatedly before they could even get a clear look.

“What are you waiting for? Go!” Liaojing’s low shout snapped Yuan Zhixuan out of her daze. She quickly helped Bensong up, and the two began to limp away.

Liaowu let out a great roar, lunged forward, and threw a palm strike to stop Bensong, but he was intercepted by Liaojing. His skill was far superior to the four Proctor Monks—he was also Benyue’s master—and the power of his Thousand-Hand Guanyin Palm was fierce and formidable. But it was unexpectedly countered by Liaojing's Flower-Weaving Palm. Striking left and right, he couldn't break free. Liaojing simultaneously kept the other four Proctor Monks at bay, handling all five of them with ease.

Liaowu was both shocked and enraged. “Which court’s Hall Monk are you? Do you know that by harboring a criminal, you are equally guilty?”

'I’d have to be an idiot to answer you,' Liaojing thought. He knew that only by defeating these five could Bensong escape. But he couldn't bring himself to seriously injure them, so he could only do his best to tie them down.

As he hesitated, he suddenly heard an extremely faint whistling sound. In the next instant, a piece of his mask shattered, yet he felt nothing at the point of impact.

A chill ran down Liaojing’s spine—the Flower-Plucking Finger!

In that moment, he understood everything. Ming Buxiang's target had always been him; Bensong was just a trap he happened to fall into. The moment he made a move, he had played right into the scheme. If his identity was revealed in front of Liaowu and the others while he was protecting Bensong, he would surely be expelled from the temple.

He had no time to look around. The night was dark, and the reeds on both sides of the path were taller than a man’s waist; he had no idea where Ming Buxiang was hiding.

Another extremely faint gust of wind shot toward him, and another piece of Liaojing’s mask broke off.

If his face was revealed, his only choice would be to kill these five to silence them.

Silence them with death or be expelled from the temple—this was the dilemma Ming Buxiang had presented him. Both were paths of no return.

But Liaojing still had his own way.

Just before the third whistle sounded, Liaojing dodged Liaowu’s Thousand-Hand Guanyin Palm, his right hand forming a claw and grabbing Liaowu’s monastic robes. With a rip, he tore off a large piece of the fabric.

Just as the whistle sounded, Liaojing spun the half-robe in his hand. Infusing it with internal energy, the cloth billowed out. Liaojing swung the garment as if it were an inflated leather ball, deflecting and striking simultaneously, dissipating the formless finger force while hitting Liaowu in the chest. Liaowu’s breathing was sealed; he grunted and immediately passed out.

Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art.

This was the secret weapon he had prepared for Ming Buxiang. Knowing that the man was nearby, he could no longer afford to hold back.

With Liaowu down, the remaining four monks were easier to deal with. Liaojing spun the cloth robe, and in just a moment, the other four also collapsed, unconscious.

“Come out, Nephew Ming,” Liaojing said. “We’re all familiar with each other here. No need to hide.”

Ming Buxiang walked out slowly from the tall grass.

Liaojing channeled his true energy, and the half-robe in his hand immediately swelled with air.

This demon had to be eliminated today!

Ming Buxiang looked around and said faintly, “I didn't expect you to know the Kasaya Demon-Subduing Art.” He then added, “You’ve fought with them, and now you want to fight me. Do you have enough strength left?”

“I’m twelve years your senior. I can afford to give you a slight advantage.”

Ming Buxiang shook his head and said lightly, “No, let me give you one instead. Tomorrow, at midnight, I will wait for you here. Just you and me.”

Liaojing asked, “What is your ultimate goal?”

Ming Buxiang did not answer and leaped back into the grass. Liaojing did not give chase. Ming Buxiang was right; fighting him now would put himself at a disadvantage.

'If I had known, I wouldn't have hesitated at the start. I should have taken them down quickly instead of wasting energy,' Liaojing thought with regret. But he also knew that Ming Buxiang was confident enough to let him go for a reason.

As for himself, he had no confidence at all.

The eighth day of the fourth month, Buddha’s Birthday.

When Liaowu woke up, he caused quite a stir, and the matter reached the Hall of Upright Action. All they knew was that Bensong was missing, and the matter required further investigation.

Nothing else of note happened on Buddha’s Birthday; it concluded successfully.

Liaojing spent the entire day regulating his breathing, bringing himself to his peak condition. Then he went to the Observing Sufferings Court, ate a few of his master’s pastries, and told his master to take care.

At midnight, Liaojing arrived at the designated spot, waiting for Ming Buxiang’s arrival.
