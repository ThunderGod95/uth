# Chapter 8: Restless and Impatient

Kunlun Year 83, summer, fifth month.

The sun was high in the sky, and monks gathered on the main road before the Four Courts of Shaolin Temple.

The crowd had left a thirty-zhang clearing, roped off on all sides. 

Facing the Great Hall of Heroes were two long tables and four chairs. Seated there, starting from the center, the first on the left was First Seat Juekong of the Universal Virtue Court, the second was Abbot Juejian of the Hall of Upright Action, and on the right were First Seat Jueyun of the Unique Wisdom Court and Abbot Jueming of the Hall of True Insight.

A monk stood in the center of the clearing, tall and broad-shouldered, with a powerful and sturdy build; this was Hall Monk Liaogang of the Unique Wisdom Court.

A lay disciple walked into the clearing, first bowing to each of the four first seats and abbots in turn. He then turned to the monk, clasped his fists, and said, "Disciple Wang Yangsheng, here for the martial trial. I ask Martial Uncle for his guidance!"

With that, he loosely clenched his hands into fists, as if holding goose eggs—the stance of Shaolin's Gripping Stone Fist. He gave a low shout and thrust out a punch, initiating his attack.

The Gripping Stone Fist was one of Shaolin Temple's more profound fist techniques, where one clenched their fist as if gripping a stone, training the second knuckles of the fingers to be used for striking. The knuckles are the hardest part of the human body, and clenching the fist as if gripping a stone allowed the force of the punch to be concentrated in them, more than doubling the damage.

However, the fist was held loosely, leaving a gap between the fingers and palm; if the fingers collapsed inward upon striking an enemy, the force would be dissipated instead. The Gripping Stone Fist had extremely high requirements for finger strength. If mastered, it served as a foundation for practicing the lower-hall martial art, Diamond Finger, and with further progress, one could learn the Dragon's Claw, an upper-hall martial art.

Wang Yangsheng was twenty-four this year, and this was his fifth time participating in the martial trial. He had been practicing the Gripping Stone Fist for seven years, and a single punch from him could shatter a two-inch-thick cypress plank as if it were rotten wood. He unleashed a flurry of rapid punches, executing the Gripping Stone Fist sequence with clear and distinct stances, a testament to the untold effort he had poured into his training.

Liaogang met his moves and dismantled them with great steadiness. Just as they reached the thirty-second move, Liaogang feigned an opening. Wang Yangsheng spotted it with remarkable precision and landed a right fist squarely on Liaogang's chest.

A sudden cry of "Aiyo!" was heard, but it was Wang Yangsheng who retreated, clutching his right hand.

Jueyun shook his head and said, "A pity, you were just short. Come back next year, and you should be able to pass."

Wang Yangsheng, dejected, first clasped his fists and bowed to Liaogang. 

"Thank you for your instruction, Senior Brother."

He then bowed to the four elders and retreated into the crowd. As he withdrew, he cradled his right hand with his left; clearly, his punch had not only failed to injure Liaogang but had broken his own hand in the process.

Though he felt it was a pity, he was not disheartened. He had practiced martial arts for sixteen years and would be twenty-five next year; he should be able to pass the martial trial then, which was not considered old in Shaolin.

In truth, with Wang Yangsheng's skill, had he joined another sect or a branch of Shaolin, he could have received his Writ of Chivalry years ago. But it was common knowledge that the Kongtong and Shaolin sects were extremely strict in their examinations for the Writ of Chivalry. Once a Shaolin disciple passed the martial trial, it signified they possessed a certain level of strength, and the Writ of Chivalry issued by Shaolin commanded a much higher price for bodyguard or escort work than those from other sects. The Writ of Chivalry could only be received once, and obtaining it meant you were a disciple of that sect for life, forbidden from joining another. Therefore, Wang Yangsheng would rather train for a few more years than switch to another sect to receive his writ.

Shaolin's martial trials were not held on a fixed schedule. If a disciple wished to take the trial and receive a Writ of Chivalry, they would register with the Unique Wisdom Court. When enough disciples had signed up, the Unique Wisdom Court would select a relatively quiet day at the temple to hold the event.

Generally speaking, disciples of average aptitude would receive their Writ of Chivalry around the age of twenty-five. Those with better aptitude who had started their training early would pass the trial at twenty-two. Someone like Lü Changfeng, with excellent aptitude and a serious attitude, could usually overcome this hurdle around the age of twenty. As for those who could pass the trial around the age of eighteen, they were considered geniuses of the highest order, truly rare talents.

The martial trial was usually presided over by one abbot from each of the Unique Wisdom and Universal Virtue Courts. This was because the Universal Virtue Court was in charge of discipline, and its Hall Monks were required to apprehend criminals and fugitives; thus, when they encountered disciples with good aptitude and martial skills, they were often given priority to recruit them. As the Unique Wisdom Court managed the sutras and martial arts, it was natural for them to preside as well, making it convenient to offer guidance to the disciples' techniques.

But today's martial trial had two additional first seats in attendance, which naturally meant there was someone worth watching among the participants.

"Disciple Ming Buxiang, I ask Martial Uncle for his guidance."

"Huh?" Many in the spectating crowd of monks cried out in surprise. The handsome youth still had a boyish look on his face and appeared to be only fifteen or sixteen years old—he was also here to take the trial? Those who had heard of Ming Buxiang knew he was a newcomer highly regarded by Abbots Juejian and Jueming, and they too found it deeply strange.

Juekong looked at Ming Buxiang and asked, "Ming Buxiang, how old are you this year?"

Ming Buxiang said, "I will be sixteen in the eighth month."

Another wave of surprised murmurs came from the crowd, this time mixed with some dismissive laughter.

There was reason for this laughter; in the eighty-odd years since the Kunlun council, the youngest person to pass the martial trial at Shaolin Temple was seventeen. Previously, Jueru had held Liaojing in high regard, hoping only that he could pass the trial before he turned nineteen to bring him honor. Who would have known that Liaojing was lazy and afraid of having to work in a hall after receiving his Writ of Chivalry? He had dragged his feet, faked illnesses, and feigned injuries until Jueru promised to find him a cushy post, only then agreeing to take the trial before he turned twenty-four.

Liaogang said, "Though you are young, I will not show favoritism. You must be careful to protect yourself."

"Disciple understands."

After speaking, he adopted no stance at all, simply walking up to Liaogang and jabbing a finger toward him.

Liaogang saw that the finger jab was coming very slowly and, expecting him to change his move, did not dodge. Suddenly, Ming Buxiang's arm shot out and struck the Shanzhong acupoint on Liaogang's chest. Liaogang's face instantly turned deathly pale, and he stumbled back several steps, coughing uncontrollably.

Only then did Ming Buxiang bow and say, "Martial Uncle let me win."

This move surprised even Juejian and Jueming, who were familiar with Ming Buxiang, and they couldn't help but exclaim, "Good!"

Hisses suddenly rose from the surrounding crowd, and someone whispered, "What was that? Did he just throw the fight?"

It turned out that Liaogang's nickname was _Iron Chunk,_ and he had mastered the Iron Shirt technique to a profound degree. One must understand that in a martial trial, fists and feet have no eyes, and accidents were unavoidable. The testing monk needed to have some form of protection, and Liaogang's skill was perfectly suited for this. Even Wang Yangsheng, who had practiced the Gripping Stone Fist for seven years, had only managed to injure his own knuckles. No one believed that Ming Buxiang could knock Liaogang down with a single, light finger jab.

Liaogang was an orthodox monk of the Unique Wisdom Court. The monks who knew of Juejian's favoritism toward Ming Buxiang simply assumed that either Juejian or Jueming had instructed Liaogang to throw the fight. 

Only the monks with higher martial skill could see the ingenuity of Ming Buxiang's finger jab. At first, his movement was extremely slow, but when he came within three chi of Liaogang's chest, it became as fast as a flash of lightning.

Liaogang, for one, expected him to change his move, and for another, never imagined the jab could become so fast. The Shanzhong acupoint was the gate of qi; with the gate broken, even a master of the Iron Shirt technique was defenseless. Ming Buxiang had already won.

This seemingly ordinary finger jab had first taken advantage of Liaogang's wait-and-see attitude, transitioning from slow to sudden, faster than lightning. The finger strength was formidable, breaking the gate of qi with a single poke. It was truly a great display of martial arts; though its power was not immense, it demonstrated a glimpse into the profound essence of martial principles.

Juejian heard the dissenting voices and thought, 'You lot think you can see the mystery in that jab? You're far from it.'

He couldn't be bothered with them and looked toward Jueyun. Jueyun was also stunned by Ming Buxiang's move, only speaking after a moment, "Ming Buxiang passes the martial trial and shall receive the Writ of Chivalry."

Ming Buxiang bowed and said, "Thank you, First Seat."

As soon as these words were spoken, the monks below began to whisper to each other, clearly unconvinced.

Juekong suddenly said, "Hold on."

He had always possessed an imposing presence, and the moment he spoke, the clearing fell silent.

Juejian looked at Juekong and asked, "What are your thoughts, First Seat?"

Juekong first looked at Ming Buxiang and asked, "Your name is Ming Buxiang?"

Ming Buxiang clasped his fists and bowed respectfully, "Yes."

Juekong nodded. "This Seat has heard of you. Very good, indeed."

Those who knew Juekong understood that for him to say "very good" was already the highest of praise. They had thought he merely wanted to praise Ming Buxiang, but then he continued, "The crowd cannot see the ingenuity of your finger jab. If you receive the Writ of Chivalry like this, I'm afraid the other disciples will not be convinced."

Juejian asked, "How else does the First Seat wish to test the disciple?"

Juekong said, "Liaogang is injured and cannot continue fighting. Switching to another disciple of the same cultivation level would likely also fail to show the crowd what you are capable of. How about this…" As Juekong spoke, he held up three fingers.

Juejian frowned. "You want him to receive three of your moves, First Seat? That is asking too much."

Juekong said, "How about sparring with this Seat for thirty moves?"

When he finished speaking, everyone present was shocked. Intimidated by Juekong's authority, they dared not speak out, but they all thought, 'Lasting thirty moves against First Seat Juekong would be difficult even for a first-rate master. Could it be that the First Seat is intentionally trying to embarrass Abbot Juejian and ruin his arrangements?'

Most of them now believed that Ming Buxiang's finger jab was the result of either Juejian or Jueming instructing Liaogang to throw the fight. Both of them were orthodox monks, and Juekong, unable to stand by and watch, had intervened.

Juejian also frowned and said with a cold laugh, "If this humble monk had not known you for twenty years and understood that you do not jest, First Seat, anyone else hearing those words might think this disciple had some deep-seated feud with you from a past life."

Juekong said, "If this Seat wanted to harm him, I wouldn't need thirty moves."

He stood up, his tall figure making his imposing presence even more intimidating. He asked Ming Buxiang, "Are you willing to try?"

Ming Buxiang clasped his hands and bowed. "This disciple cannot receive thirty of the First Seat's moves."

Juekong said, "Rest assured, I will not harm you."

Juejian said lightly, "You have already passed the trial. You don't have to force yourself."

Ming Buxiang thought for a moment and said, "Disciple will be bold. I ask the First Seat for his guidance."

Seeing that Ming Buxiang had actually agreed, Juejian initially wanted to stop him, but on second thought, he mused, 'With Juekong's status, if he were to truly injure a sixteen-year-old disciple in front of everyone, it would be a great loss of face.'

So he instructed Ming Buxiang, "Be careful."

Juekong walked around the table and stood before Ming Buxiang. He was tall and straight, a full head taller than Ming Buxiang. The contrast between them gave the impression of a bully picking on someone smaller.

Juekong said, "Make your move."

Ming Buxiang placed his left palm against his right hand and struck toward Juekong's chest faster than lightning. It looked like a polite opening move, but it concealed an attack. Juekong extended an arm to block, using the most rudimentary Arhat Fist.

Before his move grew stale, Ming Buxiang spun around, bent low, and swept at Juekong's legs—a common move called _Autumn Wind Sweeps the Fallen Leaves._ Juekong had just dodged the kick when a move from the Arhat Fist, _Lazy Stretch,_ struck toward his chest, immediately followed by Ming Buxiang using _Tiger Tumble_ from the Tiger-Taming Fist.

Ming Buxiang executed seven or eight moves in a row, all of them basic techniques from the lower-hall martial arts. Yet it was this series of simple skills that truly astonished the crowd, filling them with admiration.

It turned out that although Ming Buxiang was using basic martial arts, the consecutive moves were completely unrelated, yet they flowed together seamlessly.

One must understand that in a martial arts set, the moves are often closely linked to form a coherent system for defeating an enemy; this is called a routine. Routines exist in the hope that a subsequent move can cover the opening of a previous one, or continue its offensive momentum. 

For example, the Gripping Stone Fist that Wang Yangsheng had just used was a thirty-four-move fist form, with each move complementing the others. When a martial art is practiced to a profound level, one can naturally adapt to the situation and use moves interchangeably. But generally speaking, routines are the result of research, refinement, and polishing by many predecessors, so it is naturally the moves from the same set that complement each other best.

Yet Ming Buxiang had strung together many lower-hall martial arts without any sense of obstruction, as if it were perfectly natural.

In the blink of an eye, Ming Buxiang had launched seventeen attacks, using six different martial arts in succession, making it look like a completely new technique. By this point, everyone could see that Juekong was not seriously fighting Ming Buxiang. He only defended and never attacked, using nothing but the Arhat Fist. No matter what kind of trick Ming Buxiang pulled, Juekong would only respond with the Arhat Fist. 

However, even though it was only the Arhat Fist, Ming Buxiang was unable to get close to Juekong. On the contrary, he looked battered and exhausted as he dodged and blocked. From this perspective, it seemed as if Juekong was using his own profound foundation, accumulated over many years, to mock Ming Buxiang's youth and weakness.

But Ming Buxiang was not one to be outdone, displaying all sorts of variations as their fight intensified. Each move was faster than the last, leaving the spectating disciples breathless and unable to keep up. 

By the thirtieth move, Ming Buxiang used a move called _Yaksha Probes the Sea,_ jabbing his index and middle fingers together toward the Shanzhong acupoint on Juekong's chest. Juekong also extended two fingers and neatly caught Ming Buxiang's fingers between them. At this, the crowd of monks erupted in loud cheers.

In this exchange, Ming Buxiang had attacked for thirty moves, using eleven different entry-level martial arts. He was not only proficient but also broadly learned, and furthermore, he could integrate his knowledge and adapt to any situation. There was no longer any doubt that he would pass the martial trial.

Even Wang Yangsheng, who had been defeated earlier, couldn't help but sigh that such a genius truly existed in the world; indeed, comparisons are odious.

Juekong released Ming Buxiang's fingers and said lightly, "A pity. If you had learned the Flower-Plucking Finger, you could have injured me with formless finger energy with that move."

Ming Buxiang looked quite vexed. "That is an upper-hall martial art. It will be a long time before this disciple can learn it."

"With your aptitude, it won't take long," Juekong said. "You have experience in the Unique Wisdom Court and the Universal Virtue Court. How about you go to the Observing Sufferings Court to gain some experience?"

Hearing this, Juejian sneered inwardly. So Juekong had personally tested Ming Buxiang with the intention of recruiting him for his own use.

Ming Buxiang was heard nodding and replying, "Disciple is willing."

Juekong nodded, said no more, and returned to his seat.

In fact, Juejian's guess was only half right. Although Juekong didn't believe Liaojing's words, there was one point of suspicion. Liaojing was a standout among the younger generation in the temple; if Ming Buxiang had caught him in the act of murder, how could he have escaped being killed? When he saw the way Ming Buxiang defeated Liaogang, he knew the boy was exceptionally talented and could indeed have held off Liaojing for a while.

'If he wanted to hide his abilities, he wouldn't have needed to defeat Liaogang in such a flashy manner, and he could have fought the thirty-move exchange just now in a more straightforward way.'

Juekong thought that on the final move, he had given him an opportunity to win using the Flower-Plucking Finger. When experts fought, sometimes their on-the-spot reactions were faster than conscious thought. Just now, he had even deliberately sped up the exchange. If Ming Buxiang had unintentionally used the Flower-Plucking Finger, then what Liaojing had said would be true.

However, as he had expected, Ming Buxiang did not know the Flower-Plucking Finger. The foundation, moves, adaptability, and talent he displayed were precisely the limit of what a prodigious youth capable of withstanding a dozen of Liaojing's moves could show—nothing more. There was no trace on him of having learned any upper-hall martial arts; every move was a clean and crisp entry-level technique.

Only after proving Ming Buxiang's innocence did Juekong begin to consider taking him under his wing. However, there was no need to rush this matter.

After Ming Buxiang, the martial trial seemed to lose its momentum. Some disciples who had wanted to take the trial were so demoralized after witnessing Ming Buxiang's ability that their performance was worse than usual, resulting in a few more of them being eliminated for no good reason.

After the Dragon Boat Festival, the days grew hotter, and people became restless.

Juejian summoned Ming Buxiang to ask about his future plans. Ming Buxiang said he hoped to travel through all Four Courts and then enter the martial world for a few years. Juejian praised his idea, hinted that Ming Buxiang should cultivate diligently and not be swayed by outside evils, and then sent him away with a few plain rice dumplings.

At this time, Abbot Juesheng suddenly fell ill.

Perhaps the case of Jueru and the conflict between the orthodox and secular factions had exhausted the seventy-year-old eminent monk. Or perhaps his advanced age simply couldn't withstand a cold. After Buddha's Birthday, Juesheng had developed a cough, and by the time the Dragon Boat Festival passed, he was suffering from chest tightness and shortness of breath, unable to control it.

It was at this precise moment that a fast horse galloped into the Buddha Capital, bringing the terrible news of the death of Sect Master Zhuge of the Diancang sect.

Generally, when the sect master of any major or minor sect passed away, the abbot of the Hall of True Mindfulness in the Observing Sufferings Court would dispatch an envoy to express condolences, the gesture varying with the closeness of the relationship and the size of the sect. 

But the passing of a sect master of one of the Nine Great Families was no small matter and often required the abbot to go in person. Firstly, it was a sign of respect. Secondly, aside from the Kunlun council, the sect masters of the Nine Great Families had few opportunities to meet, so this was a chance to exchange information. Thirdly, it was also an opportunity to observe the character and personality of the new successor.

Abbot Juesheng had intended to go despite his illness but was persuaded to stay by everyone. Below Juesheng in rank was First Seat Jueyun of the Unique Wisdom Court. However, Jueyun had always buried himself in the study of Buddhist scripture and martial arts and had little contact with the martial sects. Besides, observing the character of a successor was a delicate matter, and Jueyun was not necessarily up to the task.

The best candidate was undoubtedly Juekong. Everyone in the martial world knew he was the de facto second-in-command of Shaolin, and Juekong himself would not trust this matter to anyone else.

After sending the messenger away, Juekong delayed his departure for a few days.

He was waiting for someone: Liaoping.

Liaoping, the abbot of Puan Temple in Hebei, was of secular monk origin. He had just turned thirty-eight in the fourth month and had a nickname: _Stone._

This did not refer to him being foolish or stubborn; on the contrary, he was sharp and capable, diligent and hardworking, a trusted aide to First Seat Juekong. The nickname _Stone_ came from a comment made by Abbot Juewen of the Hall of True Mindfulness: "Liaoping is like a stone. Though he looks plain and unadorned, he can withstand polishing, and no one can easily shatter him."

He was someone Juekong had carefully cultivated among the ‘Liao’ generation. He was patient and well-suited to handling a multitude of complicated tasks. Having been stationed in Hebei for the past few years, he was uninvolved in the old grievances between the temple's orthodox and secular factions. This was also the reason Juekong recommended him to replace Jueru, who had been transferred to Shanxi, as the new abbot of the Hall of True Speech.

Upon receiving his transfer order, he quickly handed over his temple's affairs and rushed from Hebei on horseback. Before even seeing the abbot, he hurried first to the Universal Virtue Court. Juekong had delayed his journey precisely to wait for him.

"You once served as a Hall Monk in the Hall of True Speech, so you are familiar with its affairs," Juekong said. "Be cautious in your work, don't stir up trouble, and if you encounter difficulties, seek out Jueji for help."

Juekong was a man of few words; he had waited three days just to impart these few sentences. Liaoping naturally understood the meaning behind the instructions and quickly said, "Disciple understands."

Juekong nodded and set off for Diancang.

After meeting with Juekong, Liaoping went to the Great Hall of Heroes to pay his respects to Abbot Juesheng. By now, Juesheng's complexion was extremely poor. While his tone was not yet weak, it lacked the vigor of the past.

Juesheng sat on a prayer mat, first offering a few words of encouragement to Liaoping before saying, "According to temple rules, abbots of the Four Courts or Eight Halls and above are personally taught the Yijin Jing by the head abbot. Starting today, come here after morning lessons, and I will transmit the mental cultivation methods and incantations to you for you to memorize and practice. But do not forget your spiritual cultivation; know that martial arts are secondary, and the Dharma is fundamental. The purpose of learning martial arts is to protect the Dharma and subdue demons…"

Reaching this point, he remembered that Liaoping came from a secular monk background and might not agree with his views, so he changed his tone.

"In any case, the hall's duties are heavy, and the road is long. Be careful, be careful."

After saying "be careful" twice, he couldn't help but cough a few times.

Liaoping quickly said, "Abbot, take care of your health."

Juesheng added, "The temple has not been peaceful recently. You are aware of the conflict between the orthodox and secular factions. Jueru is an orthodox monk, and you are a secular monk. By taking his place, there will surely be orthodox monks who are not convinced. You must have some patience."

"Disciple understands."

Leaving the Great Hall of Heroes, Liaoping thought that a dozen years ago when he had left Shaolin for Hebei, the abbot had been hale and hearty, yet today he was frail and old. He couldn't help but sigh at the swift passage of time.

After meeting with Juekong and the abbot, his next stop was his immediate superior, Jueguan.

The thought of Jueguan made Liaoping's heart clench. It was common knowledge that Jueguan held a deep prejudice against secular monks; the proposal to change the secular monks' names had been initiated by him and Jueru. Furthermore, Jueguan was the most radical leader of the anti-secular faction. The secular monks had given Jueguan the nickname _Inside Blade,_ mocking him for specializing in stabbing his own people. This visit was likely to be met with difficulties.

Liaoping braced himself and entered the Observing Sufferings Court. As he passed the Hall of True Speech, he happened to see a handsome youth walk out of the layman's quarters. He greeted him and asked, "Excuse me, is First Seat Jueguan in?"

The youth asked, "May I ask which Senior Brother you are?"

Liaoping said, "This humble monk's Dharma name is Liaoping."

The youth hurriedly bowed. "Disciple Ming Buxiang pays his respects to the abbot."

Liaoping asked, "Whose disciple are you?"

"My master is Liaoxin."

Liaoxin's disappearance had caused a great stir, which Liaoping had of course heard about. He couldn't help but ask in surprise, "Liaoxin? Isn't he a Proctor Monk of the Hall of Upright Action? What are you doing here?"

"This disciple is currently an In-Hall Layman of the Hall of True Speech."

Liaoping was even more surprised. "How old are you?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "I will be sixteen this eighth month."

Liaoping clicked his tongue in wonder and asked, "How long have you been an In-Hall Layman? What do you do?"

Ming Buxiang said, "I served as an In-Hall Layman in the Hall of True Insight for five months and was just transferred to the Hall of True Speech for official duties three days ago. I am responsible for calculating and inspecting the temple's oil supply."

Seeing that he was also a newcomer, Liaoping felt a sense of kinship and asked, "Where are you headed?"

"I live in the Hall of Upright Action and was just about to head back."

Liaoping smiled. "You live in the Hall of Upright Action, served as an In-Hall Layman in the Hall of True Insight, and now work in the Hall of True Speech. At such a young age, your experience is truly remarkable. You must study hard."

He patted Ming Buxiang on the shoulder and asked, "Is First Seat Jueguan in?"

"The First Seat is still handling official business. Does the abbot need this disciple to lead the way?"

Liaoping waved his hand. "No need, I know the way."

He arrived at the main hall and paid his respects to Jueguan. Unexpectedly, Jueguan did not make things difficult for him. Instead, he politely brought out a thick stack of documents from his room and said, "Jueru left for his new post early, so these are the handover matters he left behind. Be diligent these next few days and look through them first. If you have any questions, just ask me."

Liaoping quickly agreed and accepted the documents. Jueguan smiled, offered a few words of encouragement, and saw him off.

Liaoping thought to himself that perhaps Jueguan was not as malicious as he had imagined; the moniker _Inside Blade_ seemed too severe.

The Hall of True Speech was responsible for all of Shaolin Temple's political affairs, which also included general duties, making it the hall with the most tedious and complex tasks. Everything from the temple's daily regulations, food and clothing expenses, population census, care for the old and weak in the vicinity, to the salaries and promotions of Hall Monks fell under the jurisdiction of the Hall of True Speech.

There was a saying in the temple: "If there's something in Shaolin you don't know who to see about, then go to the Hall of True Speech."

Liaoping had a natural talent for internal affairs. He spent only one night reading through all the documents and records. The next day, after morning lessons, he went to the Great Hall of Heroes to learn the Yijin Jing from the abbot. The Yijin Jing, though it had an original text, was never shown to outsiders and was only transmitted orally. The abbot was ill, and speaking was already a bit of a strain for him, but Liaoping was exceptionally gifted and could often grasp the concepts from a single example, saving the abbot much effort. In less than an hour, he had more or less learned the day's lesson. The abbot nodded at him with a smile, showing great approval.

More than a month passed. Liaoping thought that although the month had been busy, it had been peaceful overall. First Seat Jueguan had not only refrained from making things difficult for him but had actually treated him with considerable courtesy. It was said that the conflict between the orthodox and secular factions was irreconcilable, but now it seemed not as intense as imagined. He figured that although the abbot had exiled Jueru, appointing a secular monk as the abbot of the Hall of True Speech was a fair disposition that had dissipated the resentment on both sides.

At that moment, a knock came at the door. Liaoping asked, "Who is it? Come in."

A monk entered and said, "The residents of the Buddha Capital have sent a petition regarding the digging of a well."

"Digging a well is a public work. Public works fall under the jurisdiction of the Hall of True Contemplation in the Earth Treasury Court. Why would they come to me?"

"It's not that simple. This is a petition from the residents of the Buddha Capital."

It turned out that over the past few decades, the Buddha Capital had grown increasingly prosperous, and its population had swelled, causing the city to expand. The wells within the city were limited, and some outlying areas had no access to them, requiring residents to walk a long way to fetch water, which was extremely inconvenient. The people living in these areas were mostly poor and had no land on which to dig a well. Six months ago, they had appealed to Shaolin Temple for help. Abbot Juesheng, acting out of compassion, had promised to dig a well for them. The Hall of True Contemplation had sent people to survey the area, and the land had even been purchased before Jueru's departure.

Liaoping said, "Since the land has been bought, why hasn't work begun? How long does it take to dig a well?"

The monk said, "When the residents first petitioned the abbot, it was unclear who should handle the matter, so the Hall of True Speech took it on. Although the land is bought, you, Abbot, still need to issue an official document to the Hall of True Contemplation to begin construction."

"That's simple. I'll just issue the document." He immediately wrote the official notice, instructing the Hall of True Contemplation to commence work.

A few days later, he went to the Great Hall of Heroes to practice the Yijin Jing. Before he left, the abbot suddenly asked about the well in the Buddha Capital. Liaoping's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly said, "It is being handled."

The abbot said, "The world is vast, and the poor and weak are many. There is little that Shaolin Temple can do. If we cannot even care for the Buddha Capital, which is right at our doorstep, how can we extend our grace to all and benefit the world?"

This urging from the abbot made Liaoping anxious. Returning to the Hall of True Speech, he saw an official document from the Hall of True Contemplation. He opened it and read: "In reference to the previous correspondence, which has been reviewed, please reply again with the reviewed document to confirm its accuracy before the matter can be handled as per the letter."

Liaoping was bewildered by this. When had any document ever been issued for this matter? He walked out of the hall, looked around, and happened to see Ming Buxiang. He called him over, showed him the document, and asked, "What does this mean?"

Ming Buxiang looked at the document and asked, "Is this about the well?"

"Yes, it is. Did the Hall of True Contemplation send a document about this before?"

"After the Hall of True Contemplation finished surveying the land, they sent over an official document with the well's location and the surrounding land marked on it. The Hall of True Contemplation's meaning is that the abbot needs to reply with that document, the one with the map, before they can begin work."

"That's strange."

He had gone through all the documents in the hall during this time but had not seen the one Ming Buxiang mentioned. He searched everywhere in his study but still couldn't find it, so he said to Ming Buxiang, "Come and help me look."

Ming Buxiang entered the study and searched with Liaoping, but they still couldn't find it. He then suggested, "Why not ask First Seat Jueguan?"

Liaoping thought that made sense, so he went to see Jueguan and asked if Jueru had handed over this document.

Jueguan rubbed his head and said, "I know about this matter, but this document… Jueru didn't give it to me. Alas, your martial uncle has always been careless. If it's lost, it's no matter. Just take a trip to the Hall of True Contemplation. You and Liaozheng are of the same generation; he should take care of you. It's just a piece of paper, what's there that can't be accommodated?"

Liaoping felt this was also reasonable and went to the Hall of True Contemplation to find Abbot Liaozheng. A Hall Monk from the Hall of True Contemplation served him tea and asked him to wait. Who knew that this wait would last a full hour?

But Liaoping's nickname _Stone_ was not for nothing; he was very patient and did not lose his temper. More than an hour later, Liaozheng finally invited him in.

Liaozheng was an orthodox monk, only two years older than Liaoping, yet he had become an abbot four years earlier. In truth, the currently powerful ‘Jue’ generation of eminent monks in Shaolin were getting on in years and would inevitably have to gradually hand over power to the ‘Liao’ generation. Liaozheng was the first, and Liaoping was the second.

Although Liaozheng had become an abbot, he had the least seniority. In meetings of the Four Courts or Eight Halls, he could often only agree meekly, not daring to voice his own opinions. There was also a generation gap between the ‘Liao’ and ‘Jue’ generations. The Earth Treasury Court managed finances and public works, and the Hall of True Contemplation was responsible for construction and procurement. In his official dealings with other abbots, he had to be extremely respectful. Seeing this, the people under him gave him the nickname _Steamed Bun,_ meaning he was weak and easily bullied, an abbot from any hall could step on him.

However, today when Steamed Bun met Stone, he conversely became the harder one. In terms of age and seniority, this Stone was a bit junior to him; in front of him, he was the senior.

The two bald heads met, and Steamed Bun first exchanged pleasantries, "Ai, I've been so busy with official duties today. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Junior Brother."

Stone could only say, "Not at all. I am the one who is sorry to disturb you, Senior Brother."

He didn't waste any more words and got straight to the point, asking about the well.

"The map attached to the document is to confirm the construction site. If you don't send the map back, and we get the location wrong, it will not only cause delays but also waste manpower and resources."

"Abbot Jueru didn't hand it over properly. That document is now missing."

Steamed Bun quickly said, "That won't do. Without the map, how can we start construction?"

Stone, after all, was durable. He remained calm and said, "Since the Buddha Capital is nearby, why don't we take a trip there together to confirm it once?"

Steamed Bun, though soft, was not vague. He added, "Without it in black and white, what if a dispute arises? You should look again. Martial Uncle Jueru would surely not misplace something so important. Or, how about I send someone to Shanxi to ask Martial Uncle Jueru?"

To make a trip from Henan to Shanxi just to ask where a document was? Even if Stone were a fool, he would know by now that Steamed Bun was intentionally making things difficult. But he was very patient, so he said, "The round trip between the two places is very time-consuming, and this is a task assigned by the abbot, so it must be handled urgently. Doesn't the Hall of True Contemplation have a copy?"

"There is a copy, but I don't know where it is. I'll look for it again. As soon as I find it, I will notify you, Senior Brother."

Stone cupped his hands and said, "Then I will have to trouble you, Senior Brother. I will take my leave."

Steamed Bun also cupped his hands and laughed heartily, "Not at all, not at all. Please."

Liaoping left the Hall of True Contemplation. He did not believe for a moment that Liaozheng would seriously look for the well map for him. Heeding First Seat Juekong's advice, he turned toward the Universal Virtue Court to ask his Martial Uncle, the Brocade Lion Jueji, for help.

Jueji was the abbot of the Hall of True Vocation. The Hall of True Vocation was responsible for Shaolin Temple's discipline; it was he who had tried to arrest Liaojing.

He was First Seat Juekong's right-hand man, strong and tall, with a disproportionately small head. In winter, when he wore a cotton-padded jacket with a circle of fur around his neck, he looked like a small lion, which earned him the nickname _Brocade Lion_ in his youth. Though the Brocade Lion was now old, he remained fierce and decisive, and many people were afraid of him.

After listening to Liaoping's complaint, Jueji roared in anger, "These orthodox monks, they're unhappy that you got the abbot position and are deliberately giving you a hard time! Don't you worry. I'll go to the Hall of True Contemplation tomorrow and see how that fellow Liaozheng tries to make excuses!"

Hearing Jueji say this, Liaoping felt slightly relieved.

Sure enough, early the next morning, Jueji arrived at the Hall of True Contemplation. Liaozheng did not dare to be neglectful and hurried out to greet him.

The Brocade Lion asked, "I went to see Liaoping last night to catch up and we talked about the well. I hear you've lost the survey map. Is that true?"

Steamed Bun quickly said, "No such thing. It's just buried in a pile of documents. I need to look for it."

"Disorderly internal affairs leading to the loss of official documents, that is a flaw. Nephew Liaozheng, you used to be a meticulous person. How is it that after gaining a position, you've become so careless?"

Facing the Brocade Lion, Steamed Bun reverted to being the weak and easily bullied Steamed Bun. He could only say, "I'll look again. It should only take a few days."

With a loud smack, the Brocade Lion slammed his palm on the table and roared, "I have to wait a few days for you? If you don't find it today, this humble monk will come and help you organize!"

Steamed Bun quickly nodded in agreement.

The abbot of the Hall of True Concentration, Jueguang, nicknamed the _Tongue-Plucking Bodhisattva,_ heard about this and commented, "No matter how hard the Steamed Bun is, it will still get snatched by a dog."

However, Steamed Bun still dragged it out until the very last moment. Only at the end of the official work hours in the afternoon did he send the document for the well digging to Stone.

Liaoping replied with the document sent from the Hall of True Contemplation, thinking the matter was settled and all would be peaceful.

Unexpectedly, the next afternoon, Ming Buxiang knocked on his door first, saying, "The eternal flame lamps in the Great Hall of Heroes are running out of oil and need to be refilled."

Just as Liaoping was about to handle it, another disciple came to report that the fifteenth of the seventh month was Sangha Jewel Day, on which new shoes were to be distributed to the entire temple. According to tradition, the shoes should have arrived a month in advance for inspection, but there was still no sign of them.

This was a major issue. Shaolin Temple had over three thousand monks and disciples, and more than three thousand pairs of shoes could not be procured in a short time. This matter also fell under the jurisdiction of the Hall of True Contemplation, so Stone had to face Steamed Bun once again.

Liaoping could only say to Ming Buxiang, "I'll deal with this when I get back."

He then hurried toward the Hall of True Contemplation.

"The monks in the temple all have different sizes. You didn't give me the sizes, so how am I supposed to procure them?" Steamed Bun said.

This was entirely reasonable; even asking Jueji for backing would be useless now. Liaoping had no choice but to rush back to the Hall of True Speech. Upon inquiry, he learned that before Buddha's Birthday, Jueru had already sent people to record the monks' shoe sizes in a notebook. However, due to the busyness of the festival, he had not sent the quantities to the Hall of True Contemplation. After Buddha's Birthday, Jueru was imprisoned, and the matter was put on hold.

Liaoping searched high and low but naturally could not find the notebook with the shoe sizes. He went to visit Jueguan again.

The Inside Blade only said, "Alas, Jueru is just a sloppy person. Who knows where he tossed it. Why don't you send someone to Shanxi to ask him?"

By now, Liaoping understood that these missing documents were most likely Jueguan's doing. But Jueguan was a first seat, and Liaoping could do nothing about it.

Liaoping was burning with anxiety. With less than twenty days left until the fifteenth of the seventh month, he dispatched all the monks of the Hall of True Speech to tally the required shoe sizes and quantities.

The next morning, he was in a daze. Abbot Juesheng asked about it, but he just said everything was fine.

When he got to the Hall of True Speech, he asked about the progress of measuring the shoe sizes from the previous night. The answer nearly made him faint.

In a whole day, out of four hundred monks, they had only managed to measure just over two hundred pairs of feet.

It turned out that the orthodox monks had somehow learned of the matter and were intentionally trying to make Liaoping look bad. When monks from the Hall of True Speech came to measure their shoes, they all found excuses to refuse or avoid them. Furthermore, Jueru was very popular, and most of the orthodox monks in the Hall of True Speech were dissatisfied with his exile, so they were not putting their full effort into their work. One orthodox monk responsible for measuring went to the Unique Wisdom Court and ended up chatting with another orthodox monk for a full hour, who then claimed he had to transcribe sutras and left without even having his shoes measured.

"Jueru's popularity is his greatest skill. It has always been difficult to win people's hearts; you must have some patience."

The Inside Blade was still the Inside Blade, his words vague and unhelpful.

"You need to spend some time to convince them. Why not lead by example?"

At this point, he had no choice but to lead by example. Liaoping gathered dozens of secular monks and went court by court, hall by hall, room by room, measuring feet. With an abbot present, the orthodox monks dared not shirk their duty and had to obediently submit to being measured. In this way, it took five days to finally get the sizes measured and the quantities sent to the Hall of True Contemplation.

Just as Liaoping breathed a sigh of relief, Ming Buxiang came again and said, "The eternal flame lamps in the Great Hall of Heroes are running out of oil and need to be refilled."

As he was about to give an order, another monk arrived, shouting, "Abbot, the residents of the Buddha Capital have all gathered at the gate, clamoring to see the head abbot to present their grievances."

"What is it now?" Liaoping asked. "Hasn't the Hall of True Contemplation started work?"

"No, there are more than a dozen monks from the Hall of True Contemplation at the site, but they haven't started work yet. That's why the common folk have come up the mountain."

"Where are they? Take me there quickly!" Liaoping immediately stood up. He first went to the mountain gate to persuade the residents to leave, but they clamored and refused to listen. Liaoping had no choice but to follow the crowd to the Buddha Capital. He saw more than ten monks sitting on a patch of empty ground, and sure enough, not a single spadeful of earth had been dug.

He went forward and asked, "Why haven't you started work?"

The dozen or so monks hastily stood up and said, "We were about to start work and were just waiting for you, Abbot."

"What are you waiting for me for?" Liaoping said angrily. "Aren't you all here already?"

"According to tradition, we need the abbot's confirmation before we can begin work. We have been waiting here for several days but haven't seen you, Abbot."

"Why did no one inform me?" Liaoping raised his voice, clearly angered. The monk spread his hands and said, "We thought the abbot was busy and didn't dare to disturb you."

"Now! Immediately! Dig!" Liaoping roared, and only then did the men start to move.

Liaoping rushed back to Shaolin. Returning to his study, he saw the documents that had piled up over the past few days sitting on his desk like a small mountain, and he felt utterly exhausted.

Word of the matter spread, reaching the Hall of Upright Action. Juejian was not pleased to see Shaolin in such turmoil and took the initiative to find fellow orthodox monks Abbot Jueguang of the Hall of True Concentration and Abbot Jueming of the Hall of True Insight to discuss the matter.

Jueguang had the nickname _Tongue-Plucking Bodhisattva_ because he was fond of making cynical remarks. His words were always sharp, vicious, and to the point, yet also reasonable. Those he spoke to were often unable to refute him and could only curse that he would surely go to the hell of tongue-plucking after death.

Jueguang's comment was: "A stone cannot beat a steamed bun. A steamed bun is soft, but it hides a knife inside. With a knife, the steamed bun becomes hard."

Clearly, he believed that the _Inside Blade_ Jueguan was the mastermind behind this affair. Indeed, without Jueguan's backing, Liaozheng would have found it difficult to stir up trouble.

Juejian said, "This is ultimately a Shaolin affair. For First Seat Jueguan to act this way is uncharitable."

Jueguang only said, "You cannot persuade him."

Abbot Jueming of the Hall of True Insight simply drank his tea and said to Juejian, "Today's effect must have a cause from a previous day. Liaoping inherited Jueru's position, so he naturally inherited the karma. This is his trial, and not necessarily a bad thing."

Not a Single Leaf Clings, indeed, not a single leaf clung to him.

Juejian still went to visit Jueguan. Jueguan only said, "If we don't give him some trouble, the secular monks will really think they're in power. Will there be any Dharma left in Shaolin then? Don't worry, I know my limits."

Juejian tried to persuade him a few more times, but Jueguan refused to listen. Ultimately, this was a matter for the Observing Sufferings Court, and Juejian could not interfere, so he had no choice but to leave.

Liaoping moved the documents back to his room and worked on them all night. After morning lessons, he went to the Great Hall of Heroes to study the Yijin Jing, then returned to continue working on the documents, only finishing around noon.

He had not slept all night, and after finishing his work, he fell into a deep sleep.

Another day passed. He saw that the abbot's face was sallow and only then remembered that Juesheng's complexion had been getting worse day by day. He couldn't help but worry and urged the abbot to take care of his health.

Juesheng smiled and said, "Life and death are determined by fate. This humble monk is seventy this year. I have lived long enough and should be heading to the next stage of my cultivation journey."

Liaoping quickly said, "Abbot, you must not say such things. Shaolin still needs you to preside over it."

Juesheng sighed. "Alas... What can I preside over? Under my watch, the conflict between the orthodox and secular factions has only intensified. I am the true sinner of Shaolin."

Liaoping was momentarily at a loss for words. Juesheng asked again, "How is that well?"

Liaoping quickly replied, "Work is being expedited. It should be completed soon."

Juesheng smiled faintly and continued to instruct him on the secrets of the Yijin Jing.

After leaving the Great Hall of Heroes, Liaoping immediately rushed to the Buddha Capital. When he arrived at the construction site, the dozen or so monks were all sitting on the ground resting. Seeing him arrive, they all rose to bow.

Liaoping walked over and looked into the well. It was about three chi deep. In all these days, a dozen construction monks had only dug three chi?

Even a stone has a temper. Liaoping was fuming and began to curse loudly. The head construction monk said, "Abbot, don't be angry. We hit a large rock as soon as we started digging. We spent three days chiseling it open before we could continue."

Liaoping scolded, "The rock has been chiseled open, and you are resting again?"

The head construction monk's expression was solemn as he said, "When we moved the rock, we found a large turtle underneath. It was a river god that had achieved sentience. We disturbed it, so according to the rules, we must hold a three-day ritual before we can continue work."

Liaoping asked again, "The turtle? Where is it?"

The construction monk said, "Our Buddha is merciful. Since it is a river god, it was naturally released. Who knows where it is roaming now."

He delivered this pack of lies with such reverence and solemnity, as if the great turtle truly existed. Liaoping was livid. He turned and left, heading to the Hall of True Contemplation to argue with Steamed Bun.

"There are always some taboos in construction work," Steamed Bun said, deflecting blame completely. "Since work has to be stopped for three days, it cannot be helped. This is the work of the Hall of True Contemplation, so I hope you can be understanding, Senior Brother."

Liaoping had no choice but to report this matter to Jueji again, which sent the Brocade Lion into a leonine rage.

"Fine! If these orthodox monks really want to cause trouble, then let's all cause trouble together!"

That evening, Jueji invited Abbot Jueci of the Hall of True Progress.

The Hall of True Progress, like the Hall of True Contemplation, belonged to the Earth Treasury Court and was in charge of the budget and finances. All of Shaolin Temple's expenditures were managed by the Hall of True Progress. Jueci was a secular monk and was extremely scrupulous when it came to money. Others called him the _Iron Rooster._

The next day, Steamed Bun found a returned official document. It turned out that the payment for procuring the monks' shoes had been rejected. Steamed Bun went to ask the Iron Rooster, who only said, "The temple has had many expenses recently. Why don't you ask the merchants if they can give a lower price?"

"The shoes are to be distributed on the fifteenth of the seventh month. There are less than ten days left. What's the point of negotiating prices at this stage?" Steamed Bun said. "Besides, the price has been the same in previous years. How is it that it was acceptable then but not now?"

"Last year's rules were for last year. If last year's rules could be used, could these shoes be ordered according to last year's quantities and sizes?"

Steamed Bun knew Jueci was making things difficult, and further words would be useless. To make matters worse, the merchant came that day to ask for the down payment. Helpless, Steamed Bun had no choice but to use the temple's food funds to pay in advance.

That night, Steamed Bun went to consult with First Seat Jueguan.

The next day, Jueguan summoned Abbot Juewen of the Hall of True Mindfulness, who was from the secular monk faction.

"Jueci wants Liaozheng to negotiate a price with the shopkeeper, but Liaozheng can't handle it," Jueguan said. "I would like to ask for your help."

Juewen's eyes widened. "The Hall of True Mindfulness is responsible for external relations, receiving guests, dispatching envoys. How did matters of money get involved with the Hall of True Mindfulness?"

"Isn't negotiating prices with a shopkeeper a form of external relations?"

Juewen said, "The Hall of True Mindfulness has always only dealt with sects from the martial world."

"Since you can deal with sects from the martial world, surely you can handle a small shopkeeper? Socializing and receiving guests, advancing and retreating in negotiations are all part of the Hall of True Mindfulness's duties. You are proficient and accustomed to it. Compared to the money-grubbing Hall of True Contemplation, the Hall of True Mindfulness should be better at dealing with people."

He then added, "Besides, the distribution of monks' shoes is originally the work of the Hall of True Speech. The Hall of True Speech and the Hall of True Mindfulness both belong to the Observing Sufferings Court. By helping him, you are also helping Liaoping."

Jueguan was Juewen's direct superior. Juewen could not refuse and had no choice but to send a disciple to negotiate with the merchant, only to be cursed at and thrown out. It wasn't the merchant's fault; they were already halfway through making the goods when he came to haggle over the price. How was that not humiliating?

Jueguang's comment on this matter was: "An Inside Blade is an Inside Blade, after all. When it cuts its own people, it aims for a fatal blow."

Although Juewen was a secular monk, he was devoted to Buddhism. In his youth, he was ignorant of worldly affairs and single-mindedly sought to enter a temple. He took an eminent monk as his master, not knowing about the distinction between orthodox and secular factions. His master happened to be a secular monk, and thereafter he was classified as one. Though he was a secular monk, he socialized little and cultivated much. Apart from aligning with Juekong, his interactions with other secular monks were not close. He had no choice but to brace himself and consult with the Iron Rooster.

"What an Inside Blade!" the Iron Rooster Jueci cursed. "To think he would even stab his own people in the Observing Sufferings Court!"

"This matter has fallen to me and must be resolved."

Jueci said, "Don't worry. Ultimately, the shoes have been ordered, and the merchant will surely deliver them. As long as the shoes are distributed normally, this matter won't involve the Hall of True Speech, and Stone will be fine. As for that Steamed Bun, I still need to teach him a lesson."

Juewen pleaded, but Jueci would not listen. With no other options, Juewen thought, 'The Hall of True Progress and the Hall of True Contemplation are both under Zide's management. Perhaps I should talk to First Seat Zide.'

That Zide was the most senior among the Four Courts or Eight Halls, but also the most conflict-averse. He came from a wealthy merchant background and was skilled in business, which was why Juekong had recommended him to be the first seat of the Earth Treasury Court. Juewen went to visit him, but Zide just hummed and hawed, saying he would communicate and handle it properly. After a few deflections, Juewen got nowhere and had to leave.

Juewen later mentioned this to Jueguang, who said, "You should not have expected anything from Zide in the first place. If he were born in Wudang, he could perform Tai Chi better than Zhang Sanfeng."

Over the next few days, work on the well continued at a snail's pace. Then it suddenly started to rain heavily, further delaying the project. Liaoping worried that the abbot would ask about it and became very anxious.

Ming Buxiang came to report again, "Abbot, we really can't wait any longer. The eternal flame lamp before the Buddha in the Great Hall of Heroes is about to go out."

"Is it out of oil?"

"It's about to hit the bottom."

"You go back first. I'm going to the Hall of True Contemplation."

Distributing lamp oil was the job of the Hall of True Speech; procuring the oil was the job of the Hall of True Contemplation. Liaoping went to the Hall of True Contemplation, but Steamed Bun said that Liaoping had not issued an official document, so he could not make the purchase, and it would take a few more days to buy it. 

Liaoping said angrily, "What if the eternal flame lamp before the Buddha's seat goes out?"

At this moment, Steamed Bun also had his own unspoken grievances. He was an orthodox monk, after all, and did not wish to see the eternal flame before the Buddha go out. However, there were hundreds of eternal flame lamps in the Great Hall of Heroes, of various sizes. For convenience in refilling, they had been specially designed by a master craftsman, with a hidden pipe inside each lamp leading to an oil tank outside the hall. That oil tank was a massive one hundred and fifty shi in size; it wasn't a problem that a pound or two of lamp oil could solve.

However, for the past ten-odd days, the Iron Rooster had been withholding funds, not releasing a single coin. The Hall of True Contemplation's funds had long been depleted. Even the food purchases for the past few days had been on credit. Where was he supposed to get the money to buy lamp oil?

Liaoping had no choice but to go to the Hall of True Progress again, at least to get the Iron Rooster to allocate some funds to solve the lamp oil problem. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped into the Hall of True Progress, he saw water leaking from various places inside, dripping incessantly. The Iron Rooster was just cursing nonstop.

It turned out that the Hall of True Progress was old and in disrepair, and had long had a leaking problem. It was supposed to be repaired by the construction monks of the Hall of True Contemplation, but now that they were at odds with Steamed Bun, the monks responsible for the repairs, who were right next door, just claimed to be busy and sent everyone out, refusing to fix it.

Liaoping knew that words were useless and turned to leave.

He decided to report everything to the abbot first thing tomorrow morning.

Unexpectedly, the one who came to teach the Yijin Jing that day was First Seat Jueyun of the Unique Wisdom Court.

"The abbot's condition has worsened," Jueyun said with a sigh. "The physician monk from the Hall of True Insight has seen him and advised him to rest well. For the time being, let's not trouble him with temple affairs."

Liaoping understood Jueyun's meaning and nodded.

"I will temporarily teach you the Yijin Jing that you are learning. Follow me."

Jueyun took out a sutra. The paper was old, clearly having seen many years, and on it were written the three large words _Yijin Jing._

"I am an orthodox monk, and you are a secular monk. To avoid controversy, we will teach according to the sutra."

"This disciple trusts Martial Uncle."

"Forget it. At this juncture, what trust is there between the orthodox and secular factions?" He opened the sutra and asked, "Where did you learn up to?"

Liaoping returned to the Hall of True Speech and thought for a long time. It was now the sixth day of the seventh month. In nine more days, the monks' shoes were to be distributed, yet not even a single straw sandal had been seen.

The oil for the Great Hall of Heroes was gone; he didn't know how many more days it could last.

The well in the Buddha Capital, who knew when it would be finished.

He truly did not know how he had survived these past two months. In a few more days, things were likely to blow up. When it came time to make an example of someone, it certainly wouldn't be the Iron Rooster, but himself, this little chicken. Whether he would become the shortest-lived abbot in the history of Shaolin Temple was truly anyone's guess.

Now the abbot was sick again. What should he do?

Thinking of the abbot falling ill, a flash of inspiration struck Liaoping. He stood up, placed his right foot on the table, and channeled his true energy into his left hand. This Great Prajna Palm was his specialty. Liaoping gritted his teeth and brought his palm down.

The next day, Ming Buxiang came again to press about the lamp oil but couldn't find Liaoping. Only then did he hear that the road was slippery due to the rain, and Liaoping had accidentally fallen and broken his leg and was now recuperating.

It was said that when Jueguan heard this news, he gritted his teeth and said, "That despicable brat!"

Liaoping lay in bed. Although his right leg was in immense pain, he felt much more at ease. This was good. Since he was injured, Jueguan, as the first seat of the Observing Sufferings Court, could not escape his connection to the affairs of the Hall of True Speech. That Inside Blade had finally stabbed himself.

He chuckled in bed, wondering who else hadn't been dragged into this chaotic mess. Could things possibly get any worse?

Things could indeed get worse. Two days later at dusk, the rain had eased slightly when suddenly, dozens of commoners gathered outside Shaolin Temple, shouting loudly, demanding that Shaolin Temple pay back its debts.

It turned out that with several thousand monks in Shaolin Temple, the daily food expenses were enormous. Liaozheng had been in arrears for over ten days, and the merchants and vegetable sellers of the Buddha Capital could no longer bear the losses and had been unable to get their money, so they had gathered a crowd to demand payment.

Liaozheng rushed to pacify them but was instead grabbed and berated by the crowd. The matter alerted the Hall of Upright Action, which thought that secular monks had caused trouble and incurred public anger, so Juejian hurried over.

※

In the Hall of True Contemplation, Juejian's neck was flushed red, and the veins on his face were bulging. He was clearly at the height of his anger. If not for his fear of creating bad karma with his words, a string of curses might have erupted from his mouth.

"Shaolin Temple has stood for a thousand years! Over a thousand years! Over a thousand years! For the first time in over a thousand years… for the first time!..."

Juejian was so angry he could barely speak coherently.

"For the first time, people have come to our door to collect debts! What are you doing?!"

In a fit of rage, he kicked out, and a wooden table instantly shattered.

Steamed Bun lowered his head, not daring to say much.

"Immediately! Settle the accounts and send those people away!" Juejian was practically roaring.

Steamed Bun stammered, "Martial Uncle... it's not that I won't pay, it's that the Hall of True Contemplation really has no money."

"Come with me!" Juejian grabbed Liaozheng and strode toward the Hall of True Progress. The roof of the Hall of True Progress had not yet been repaired, and water was still leaking incessantly, dripping all over the floor. The room was in a state of chaos. Where was the grandeur of the Four Courts or Eight Halls?

The Iron Rooster Jueci had long expected Juejian's arrival and was waiting with a grin. Seeing his smiling face, Juejian's anger flared even more. Just as he was about to erupt, he saw the smile on Jueci's face suddenly freeze.

Juejian turned his head. Behind him, a tall figure stood with an ashen face, glaring at Jueci. His yellow monk's robe was stained with water, indicating he had just come in from outside.

Who else could it be but Juekong?

As night deepened, the eternal flame lamps in the Great Hall of Heroes suddenly went out.

A shadowy figure slipped in without a sound.
