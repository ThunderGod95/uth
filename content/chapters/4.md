# Chapter 4: True Scripture, False Scripture

Kunlun Year 83, second month.

In the center of the council chamber of the Abbot's Court sat thirteen meditation cushions, and upon each cushion sat a monk.

The monk in the very center was draped in a red kasaya, with the frame of a pine and the bearing of a crane. His white eyebrows drooped low, and his compassionate eyes were half-closed; he was none other than the abbot of the Shaolin Temple, Juesheng.

Before him, to his left and right, sat six monks, each clad in a yellow kasaya. To his left, in order, were First Seat Jueyun of the Unique Wisdom Court, First Seat Jueguan of the Observing Sufferings Court, Abbot Jueming of the Hall of True Insight, Abbot Jueguang of the Hall of True Concentration, Abbot Jueru of the Hall of True Speech, and Abbot Juewen of the Hall of True Mindfulness.

The first person on the right was tall, with a straight back and a broad chest. His face was chiseled with sharp angles, and his gaze was piercing and majestic, like a keen blade resting between his brows. Even without a direct threat, it was enough to make one uneasy, a constant warning that the slightest offense would be met with a bloody wound. This was the foremost of the secular monks, First Seat Juekong of the Universal Virtue Court.

The second person on the right was round-faced and stout, his corpulent body glistening with oil, and he was the eldest of all present. He was First Seat Zide of the Earth Treasury Court, one of the few remaining monks of the 'Zi' generation in Shaolin. The next three were Abbot Juejian of the Hall of Upright Action, Abbot Jueji of the Hall of True Vocation, and Abbot Jueci of the Hall of True Progress. The last one, a man of just over forty and the youngest of the group, was Liaozheng, Abbot of the Hall of True Contemplation and the only monk of the 'Liao' generation present.

The thirteen men sat in the council chamber, yet for a time, a hush fell over them as each was lost in his own thoughts. After a long while, Abbot Juesheng spoke. "What are your thoughts?"

"I believe that changing the names of the secular monks is absolutely out of the question." Juekong's back remained ramrod straight as he spoke, his hands resting on his knees with perfect poise. Judging by appearances alone, he possessed the commanding presence of a sect leader even more so than the abbot.

He continued, "This is a matter of a discriminating mind."

"First Seat Juekong, you exaggerate." The one who spoke was First Seat Jueguan of the Observing Sufferings Court. The Observing Sufferings Court was responsible for the internal and external affairs of the Shaolin Temple, divided into the Hall of True Speech for internal matters and the Hall of True Mindfulness for external ones. Among the Four Courts and Eight Halls, Jueguan was arguably the one who most detested the secular monks, often making things difficult for them under various pretexts. He was cunning and ruthless, often striking with a single, fatal blow, leaving his victims helpless. The secular monks, who both hated and feared him, had given him the nickname "the Inside Blade." This joint council of the Four Courts had been initiated by Jueguan and Abbot Jueru of the Hall of True Speech, with the aim of forcing the secular monks to change their names.

This 'Inside Blade' continued, "Distinguishing between orthodox and secular names is for the sake of easier administration. The Shaolin Temple was originally a place of quiet cultivation, but its affairs have grown complicated over the years, disturbing our practice. We rely on the secular monks to help manage these things, and their contributions cannot be denied. Take the Universal Virtue Court, for example; its impeccable order is entirely thanks to First Seat Juekong's diligent efforts."

Juekong said coolly, "First Seat Jueguan can spare me these platitudes."

Jueguan continued, "Three months ago, Liaozhen was on official business in Zhejiang when he spent a night in a brothel, gambled away all his travel money, and was captured by the Beggar's Sect, who sent an escort back to his home to collect the funds. Two months ago, Bengang got into a brawl in Shaanxi and had his nose cut off by the Mount Hua Sect before being sent back. The Universal Virtue Court passed light sentences in both cases, but the root cause is that both men were secular monks. Bengang is young and hot-headed, prone to acts of bravado, while Liaozhen is fond of women and gambling. These are not major issues in themselves. They contribute to the temple, and if they have no mind for the Buddha, why must we be so harsh with them? Those who break the rules should be dealt with according to the regulations. But once they leave the temple, does anyone ask, 'Liaozhen, are you an orthodox monk or a secular monk? Bengang, are you an orthodox monk or a secular monk?'"

"It is not only the secular monks who fail to observe the precepts," Juekong stated. "Liaoxin has yet to return, has anyone asked whether he is orthodox or secular?"

Jueguan retorted, "The precepts are for the orthodox monks to keep, and the commandments are also for the orthodox monks to keep. Secular monks need only not break the rules. Who scrutinizes the secular monks for their morning and evening sutra lessons? Besides Shaolin, which other orthodox temple distinguishes between orthodox and secular? On the contrary, among Shaolin's sangha, there are many who do not keep the precepts."

Juekong replied, "The discord within the monastery stems from this very division between orthodox and secular monks. Instead of seeking to resolve it, First Seat Jueguan wishes to create a distinction in their very names. Will this not only intensify the conflict?"

Twenty years ago, when Old Beggar Peng laid down his sword and retired, I went to Jiangxi to congratulate him. As we reminisced, do you know what he said?" He looked at Juekong. "He said that these days, when the House of a Hundred Fragrances opens its doors and sees a monk, they don't know if he's come for a prostitute or for alms. In the martial world, the Shaolin Temple is one of the Nine Great Families, but before the Buddha, we are merely disciples. For the last ten years, of every ten monks who have violated the precepts, nine have been secular. The Shaolin Temple is a hallowed ground of Buddhism; how can we allow its disciples to insult the Three Jewels?"

Juekong countered, "There are countless monks in the world, how can you know they all come from Shaolin?"

Even in the face of the Inside Blade's mockery, the leader of the secular monks maintained his dignified air, his tone steady and composed. "Among Mount Heng, Tang Gate, and the other Nine Great Families, are there not other monastic sects under their jurisdiction?"

"The monks from other places are far more solemn than our own Shaolin monks," Jueguan replied. "My proposal is not complicated. All current secular monks and their disciples will simply add the character 'Sui' before their Dharma name, to signify they are part of the secular sangha. For example, the abbot of my court's Hall of True Mindfulness, whose Dharma name is currently Juewen, would be renamed Sui Juewen. Henceforth, the disciples of secular monks will no longer follow the 'Liao, Ben, Yuan, Ke, Wu' generational order, but will instead follow the eight-character sequence: 'Shou, Xiang, Xing, Shi, Yi, Nian, Ru, Meng.' When outsiders hear these names, they will naturally know they are secular monks and will not hold them to the precepts."

"Why should it be the secular monks who change their names?" The speaker was a middle-aged monk with broad shoulders and a stout build. Though shorter than Juekong, he was still a large man, and one could see the solid muscle beneath his robes. In contrast, his small, though well-formed, head looked almost comical atop his body. He was Jueji, the abbot of the Hall of True Vocation and a secular monk himself. As one of Juekong's most capable deputies, he was known for his courageous and fierce temperament. Due to this personality and a head that didn't match his powerful frame, he had earned the nickname "the Brocade Lion."

"For fifty years, orthodox and secular monks have coexisted, sharing the same generational naming without issue. Now the Observing Sufferings Court issues a single order demanding that all monks change their names? Is that not a bit tyrannical?" The Brocade Lion Jueji's voice was loud, laced with displeasure.

Maintaining a constant smile was Abbot Jueru of the Hall of True Speech. He was in charge of the monastery's various rules and regulations and was usually seen with a cheerful grin, earning him the nickname "the Laughing Buddha" from others in the temple. He was typically humble and courteous, a masterful diplomat who would point out his subordinates' mistakes with a smile, rarely resorting to harsh words.

This Laughing Buddha, Jueru, said, "It wouldn't be a problem for the orthodox monks to change their names either. We could simply add the character 'Shi' before the Dharma names of orthodox monks. As for the Dharma names themselves, they are merely for distinction. Orthodox and secular monks are all disciples of the temple, and there will be no difference in their treatment or status going forward."

"No difference, yet a distinction," said Abbot Juewen of the Observing Sufferings Court's Hall of True Mindfulness. He was the secular monk most devoted to the study of Buddhism. He continued, "Even if it were just an extra red thread embroidered on our robes, it would still be a distinction. Is a discriminating mind not an obstacle to cultivation?" Unlike the sharp confrontation between the two first seats, and different from Jueguan's aggressive tone, he spoke with a sense of peace, even a hint of worry.

Juewen had been devoted to the Buddha since he was young, but by a stroke of misfortune, he had mistakenly chosen a secular monk as his master and had been classified as one ever since. Most people in such an awkward position would be caught in a difficult bind, but his gentle nature, his willingness to work hard without complaint, his meticulousness, and his talent for observing people and analyzing situations had allowed him to rise through the ranks. He became First Seat Juekong's trusted aide, eventually becoming the abbot of the Hall of True Mindfulness, responsible for Shaolin's diplomatic relations with the Nine Great Families.

The Hall of True Speech and the Hall of True Mindfulness were both under the jurisdiction of the Observing Sufferings Court, and it was common knowledge that Juewen and Jueru did not get along.

Suddenly, a faint snore echoed, remarkably clear in the great hall. Juesheng looked towards First Seat Zide of the Earth Treasury Court. Zide was a corpulent man, weighing well over two hundred catties. The Earth Treasury Court was responsible for all manner of daily necessities, procurement, construction, and budgets, equivalent to the accounting, finance, and general affairs departments of other sects. Zide had spent forty years diligently saving the temple a great deal of silver through hard work and meticulous calculation, finally earning his place in the Earth Treasury Court. He only became the court's first seat in his sixties, and that was thanks to Juekong's strong recommendation.

Before becoming a monk, he had been the wealthiest man in Henan. It was said he had five concubines and a flock of children, and it was common knowledge that he had taken a new one just a few years ago. If one were to point to an example of just how secular a secular monk could be, Zide was the model; any more secular than him, and one would be on the verge of violating the commandments.

Seeing Zide asleep, everyone frowned. First Seat Jueguan, sitting directly opposite him, suddenly shouted, "Martial Uncle Zide, run! First Seat Juekong is here!"

Zide jolted awake, leaping to his feet and yelling, "Where? Where is First Seat Juekong?"

"I am right here!" Juekong said coldly. Zide then realized he had been tricked by Jueguan and sat down, his round, old face flushed with anger. Although he was a generation senior to Jueguan, he lacked authority and didn't dare to reprimand him. Still fuming at the Inside Blade, he heard Abbot Juesheng ask, "Regarding the matter of changing the secular monks' names, what are your thoughts?"

Confused, Zide hurriedly said, "Martial Nephew Juekong is right, Martial Nephew Juekong is right. My views are the same as his."

Juejian asked, "Does Martial Uncle Zide know whether First Seat Juekong is for or against it?"

Zide froze for a moment, then quickly replied, "I know, I know."

He said he knew, but from his expression, it was likely he had fallen asleep not long after the meeting began.

Abbot Jueci of the Hall of True Progress, who was under the Earth Treasury Court and nicknamed "the Iron Rooster," quickly came to Zide's defense.

"I am in agreement with Martial Uncle Zide; we both believe changing the names is improper."

With that, the head of the secular monks, Juekong; _the Brocade Lion,_ Jueji; the patriarch Zide; the devout Juewen; and "the Iron Rooster," Jueci—all five secular monks had voiced their opposition. Among the seven orthodox monks, besides First Seat Jueguan of the Observing Sufferings Court and his right-hand man, "the Laughing Buddha" Jueru, the rest had yet to speak.

Abbot Juesheng turned his head and asked, "What is First Seat Jueyun's opinion?"

Jueyun was the first seat of the Unique Wisdom Court, his status second only to the abbot, which was why the abbot asked him first. The Shaolin Temple was founded on Buddhist principles, and the majority of its territory adhered to Buddhism. The Unique Wisdom Court was responsible for the collection of scriptures, the teaching of martial arts and Buddhist doctrine, and the arrangement of important ceremonies within Shaolin's jurisdiction. All monks who entered its halls were orthodox monks, with priority given to those who had studied martial arts and Buddhist doctrine. Although Jueyun was not skilled in worldly affairs, he was deeply cultivated in the Dharma. While his attitude towards secular monks was not as radically hostile as Jueguan's, he still found it strange and peculiar that monks would not revere the Three Jewels.

Jueyun said, "Orthodox and secular are different. I do not believe the rules for cultivators need apply to secular monks. Let each follow their own path and cultivate as they see fit."

Juekong stated coldly, "In that case, let the entire lineage of secular monks return to lay life. Lay disciples can serve Shaolin just as well."

Abbot Jueguang of the Unique Wisdom Court's Hall of True Concentration retorted, "And what happens when a lay disciple takes the tonsure?"

Juekong countered, "Perhaps a better question is, if we are monks, why must we be divided into orthodox and secular? Cultivation is a matter of following one's heart, nature, and fate, yet it has been twisted to seem as if only orthodox monks can truly cultivate."

This Abbot Jueguang, nicknamed the 'Tongue-Plucking Bodhisattva', was a cultivator with a tongue as sharp and cutting as any, and he replied, "If one's heart is truly set on the Buddha, the Shaolin Temple will of course welcome all who are fated to be here. But among the secular monks, how many truly came for the Buddha? Does First Seat Juekong not know the answer in his heart?"

Juekong said, "Then why not expel all the secular monks? The lesson of the Shao-Song Conflict is still fresh. Does Abbot Jueguang wish to repeat the same mistake?"

This difficult problem of orthodox and secular monks stemmed from the rules of the Shaolin Temple. After the Kunlun council, the Shaolin Temple entered a period of recovery and recuperation. As it expanded, the temple's internal affairs grew increasingly complex.

The rules stipulated that only ordained monks could enter the halls, but since the monks had left worldly life behind to focus on the Buddha, they lacked the energy and ability to handle struggles in the martial world or to care for the common people.

At that time, there was much strife among the various sects under Shaolin's jurisdiction, which Shaolin struggled to control. On its borders, it was in constant dispute with Mount Hua over the ownership of the Lone Grave Lands. Yet, despite its status as the number one sect, Shaolin repeatedly swallowed its pride in its dealings with Mount Hua, right up until the Shao-Song Conflict.

The Mount Song sect was already a major power, and after decades of strengthening its foundation, its influence was no less than that of Mount Hua, one of the Nine Great Families. Naturally, it was unwilling to submit to Shaolin. At first, Mount Song changing its name to the Songyang Sect was just the spark, but it soon erupted into the Shao-Song Conflict.

Unexpectedly, the Shao-Song Conflict nearly drove Shaolin to ruin. The temple monks' lack of skill in scheming and their peace-loving nature repeatedly put them in perilous situations. The conflict culminated in Mount Song's forces surrounding the Shaolin Temple, and the thousand-year-old monastery was nearly destroyed in the battle.

At this critical juncture, Shaolin was saved by five lay disciples led by Zhang Qiuchi. However, due to the rule that only ordained monks may enter the halls, the five lay disciples had no choice but to be tonsured.

Zhang Qiuchi, nicknamed "Iron Brush Painting the Tide," was proficient in both literary and martial arts. He devised strategies for Shaolin, and since Shaolin's foundation was originally deeper than Mount Song's, the tide of battle soon turned. The entire Mount Song sect relocated to Shandong and never spoke of changing their name again, and their relationship with Shaolin gradually became delicate.

These five monks were the beginning of the secular monks. From then on, Shaolin's requirements for its monks were no longer based solely on religious faith but also on practical needs. This was the origin of the secular monks.

Zide, being skilled in commerce, became the first seat of the Earth Treasury Court; Juewen, adept at social interactions and able to discern the state of the martial world, was a masterful diplomat and perfectly suited to preside over the Hall of True Mindfulness.

Since the secular monks were brought in to handle worldly affairs, they were not necessarily loyal to the faith. In the beginning, they still strictly observed the commandments, but after fifty years of change, the distinction between orthodox and secular gradually emerged. Now, disciples of orthodox monks become orthodox monks, and disciples of secular monks become secular monks.

Juekong's suggestion to have the secular monks return to lay life was ultimately unfeasible, the root cause still being the rule that "only ordained monks may enter the halls."

To climb the ranks in the Shaolin Temple, one didn't even have to reach the heights of a court's first seat or a hall's abbot; even to become a common Hall Monk, one had to be tonsured. So, even if all the secular monks returned to lay life, wouldn't they have to be tonsured again to enter the halls? And how could they handle official duties without entering the halls? If lay disciples were allowed to manage the Four Courts and Eight Halls, then the entire Shaolin Temple would fall into their hands. Could it still be called a "temple"?

(TL Note: See the end of the chapter to understand this discourse better.)

This conflict between orthodox and secular monks, originally a hidden undercurrent, had officially surfaced because of Liaoxin's disappearance.

Now, among the seven orthodox monks, the esteemed First Seat Jueyun and Tongue-Plucking Bodhisattva, Jueguang, seemed to agree with changing the secular monks' names. The only ones who had not yet expressed their opinions were Jueming of the Hall of True Insight, Juejian of the Hall of Upright Action, and Liaozheng of the Hall of True Contemplation.

Abbot Juesheng looked toward Jueming, who said, "Let us first hear Senior Brother Juejian's view."

Jueming was nicknamed "Not a Single Leaf Clings"; even if he had an opinion, he had to gauge the situation first. He asked Juejian first because everyone knew of the friction between Juejian and Juekong. Although one was subordinate to the other, they had clashed countless times. The more distant issue was Liaoxin's disappearance; more recently, there was the death of Fu Yingcong and the madness of Benyue.

Juejian pondered for a moment before speaking slowly, "This humble monk believes that the matter of changing the secular monks' names requires further consideration."

His words stunned everyone present. The Hall of Upright Action was in charge of punishment, and for every ten monks who violated the commandments, nine were secular. If there was anyone in the Four Courts and Eight Halls, aside from Jueguan, who disliked the secular monks the most, it was Juejian, who was in charge of the rules of discipline. Who would have thought that at this moment, he would side with the secular monks?

In truth, Juejian's hesitation stemmed from practical considerations. Unlike the three monks of the Unique Wisdom Court who remained aloof from worldly affairs, he was a more pragmatic monk. To propose changing the secular monks' names at this time would only add fuel to the fire of the conflict.

Juejian continued, "We are all disciples of Shaolin, dedicated to serving the temple. If we create a distinction in their names, the secular monks will feel their status has been diminished, which will do nothing to help resolve the conflict."

Inside Blade, Jueguan, replied, "If there is to be no distinction, then the secular monks must observe the commandments just as the orthodox monks do. To be a monk inside the temple and a layman outside—it is completely incongruous!"

As he spoke, his gaze shifted toward Zide, but the first seat merely nodded his head, having once again dozed off.

'Not a Single Leaf Clings' Jueming also chimed in, "We are all disciples of the Buddha, why distinguish between orthodox and secular? Since cultivation is about following fate and joy, what does it matter if a secular monk is secular or a monk? The priority should be to eliminate the prejudice between us. As for names, they are but empty labels, why delve so deeply into them?" Seeing Juejian go against the grain to become the first orthodox monk to object, he no longer had any reservations. He opposed the name change, not out of pragmatism, but because he genuinely believed that it violated the Buddhist principle of equality.

Jueguan, still not giving up, continued, "If you wish to follow fate and joy, there are plenty of methods of cultivation. The Sangha is one of the Three Jewels. The Sangha Jewel must strictly observe the commandments and practice truthfully. How can we allow it to be mixed with and defiled by others?"

Juekong's voice was icy. "Are First Seat Jueguan's words meant to say that the secular monks have defiled the Shaolin Temple?"

Jueguan replied, "Those who are truly cultivating are naturally not in this category. But then again, a name is an empty form. Why should a cultivator care about a mere Dharma name?"

Juekong said, "You say there is no need to care about Dharma names, yet you propose that secular monks change their names. Does First Seat Jueguan not find his own words self-contradictory?"

Jueguan said, "The name change is for outsiders, to distinguish between orthodox and secular monks. Cultivation is one's own path; there is no conflict. Would the secular monks be unable to cultivate without their Dharma names?"

The two were at a deadlock. Seeing the conversation growing tense, Abbot Juesheng intervened, "This matter is of great importance. I hope you will all consider it carefully. In one month, it will be Buddha's Birthday. There will be many complicated tasks, and numerous devotees will come to the Shaolin Temple. Everyone must work with diligence."

Everyone put their palms together and said, "We will obey the Abbot's decree."

Just as Abbot Juesheng was about to rise, he noticed Liaozheng in the last seat and remembered that he hadn't spoken. He asked, "Does Abbot Liaozheng have any thoughts?"

Liaozheng had only recently become the abbot of the Hall of True Contemplation. He had the lowest seniority and the least experience among them all. The Earth Treasury Court was the last of the Four Courts, and the Hall of True Contemplation was the last of the Eight Halls. He had to be subservient to the other first seats and abbots, so much so that he had recently been given a new nickname in the temple: "the Steamed Bun," mocking how he could be kneaded by anyone. In this joint council of the Four Courts, they had even forgotten to let him speak.

He was about to speak when the Inside Blade, Jueguan, said coldly, "There are seven people against it. Does it matter what he says?"

The Steamed Bun could only swallow his words, press his palms together, and say respectfully, "This humble monk has no thoughts at present."

※ ※ ※

The eighth day of the fourth month was the birthday of Shakyamuni Buddha, also known as the "Festival of the Buddha Jewel," and it was the grandest festival of the year at the Shaolin Temple. It was also one of the few days the temple was open to the general public. Even then, "open" was limited to the main road outside the entrance, allowing the public to worship from afar, facing the temple gates.

During Buddha's Birthday, the liveliest place was the Buddha Capital.

Starting from the third day of the fourth month, for seven consecutive days, a ceremonial stage would be erected in the Buddha Capital to display the golden Buddha statues, Buddha bones, and seven-colored relics from Shaolin's collection for public veneration.

Devotees would bathe the Buddha statues, offer flowers and fruit, and make offerings to the monks, and pilgrims would flock from all directions. At the same time, seven Dharma assemblies would be held, where sutra monks from the Unique Wisdom Court would lecture on the scriptures. The audience often included prominent figures from various sects in the martial world.

During this period, the Unique Wisdom Court was responsible for lectures and receiving devotees, the Universal Virtue Court maintained security and guarded the temple treasures, the Observing Sufferings Court received important guests from within and without, and the Earth Treasury Court constructed the various stages and allocated expenses. The entire third month was arguably the busiest and most arduous time of the year for everyone in the Shaolin Temple.

There was, however, one person who was entirely at leisure—the scripture repository's cataloging monk, Liaojing.

The job of a cataloging monk was to register the monks who borrowed books from the scripture repository and, if they weren't returned, to report it and urge their return. So, Liaojing's job was simply to make notes in the scripture repository. If one were to speak of boredom, this was probably one of the most boring jobs in the Shaolin Temple.

Every year on Buddha's Birthday, the monks inside and outside the temple were incredibly busy, so usually, no one came to borrow books, making Liaojing even more idle than usual. He was already a Hall Monk and didn't need to do cleaning. Every day after his morning meal, he would read, and then he would practice his martial arts. Beyond that, there was nothing else.

But this year, Liaojing was not idle. He had something on his mind.

Something concerning Ming Buxiang.

Liaojing first noticed Ming Buxiang because of the astonishing speed at which he borrowed books. The scripture repository's rules stipulated that each person could only borrow two books at a time. Ming Buxiang always borrowed and returned them at the fastest possible pace. Liaojing didn't know if he had truly finished them or just skimmed through. In any case, Ming Buxiang would come to borrow books every two or three days. The types of books varied, mostly Buddhist sutras, but also a variety of other miscellaneous texts.

Liaojing had jokingly asked Ming Buxiang about it a few times, and Ming Buxiang had only replied, "I've finished them. What I don't understand, I'll understand after reading it enough times."

After a while, Liaojing paid it no mind.

He started paying attention to Ming Buxiang again when Bu Gui borrowed his first sutra from him. Liaojing was surprised, so he greeted Bu Gui and said to him, "If you encounter any difficulties with the text, you can come ask me."

He knew that Bu Gui was illiterate. From that time on, he began to observe Bu Gui and could tell from Bu Gui's interactions with Ming Buxiang that it was Ming Buxiang who was teaching him to read.

Then he saw the change in the disciples of the Hall of True Insight. He had sighed for Bu Gui having taken the wrong path, feeling it was an unfortunate tragedy.

What caught his attention was a small incident last year. A Hall Monk from the Hall of Upright Action had borrowed a copy of the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_. This was an upper-hall martial art, derived from the story of the Buddha's flower-plucking smile. It emphasized that when the finger force was unleashed, it left no trace.

Sometimes, when an opponent was struck, they wouldn't even realize it, not even knowing they were injured. It was one of the twenty-seven martial arts that required the approval of a Hall Abbot or higher to practice. He saw the written order from Abbot Jueji, retrieved the manual from the Repository of Divine Arts, and while inspecting it, found a loose page. It was pages thirty-seven and thirty-eight, and this page was naturally situated between pages thirty-six and thirty-nine.

This perfectly normal occurrence felt wrong to Liaojing.

Many of the books in the scripture repository were old, and loose or damaged pages were common. Except for the two great sutras, the _Yijin Jing_ and the _Xisui Jing_, the Hall of True Insight would usually send someone to transcribe new copies for the collection. When the copies also became old, they would be transcribed again.

This copy of the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ was a transcription.

Liaojing was naturally a lazy person. When books were returned, he was supposed to check for missing or damaged pages, but he usually just asked a few cursory questions, flipped through a few pages, and called it a day. In any case, if there was any damage, the next borrower would report it. Since it was just a copy, it didn't matter if it was damaged; at worst, he would get a scolding. And if a scolding were to be given, the previous borrower would bear the brunt of it.

He remembered clearly that the last time this book was returned, the borrowing monk had told him a page had come loose. He shook the book, and sure enough, a page fell out. He casually slipped it back into the book, checked it in, and returned it to the Repository of Divine Arts.

But now, that page was tucked into its correct place.

Liaojing was lazy, but he was meticulous. His master once told him that if he weren't so lazy, he would undoubtedly be a first-rate figure in the temple, but as it was, he was just a first-rate lazy worm.

He offered no opinion on this. He had become a monk because it was the easiest life he knew. He entered the hall at twenty-five and became a cataloging monk, and his only wish was to remain a cataloging monk for another forty years.

'Someone else has read this book,' Liaojing thought. The first person who came to mind was Bu Gui.

But the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ was an upper-hall martial art, kept on the top shelf of the Repository of Divine Arts. Bu Gui was short and hunchbacked; he couldn't have reached it. Of course, he could have gotten the book if he jumped or used a stool, but the question was, did Bu Gui have a reason to take this book?

With Bu Gui's knowledge of martial arts, he wouldn't have known which books contained advanced techniques. Why would he have insisted on getting this particular book? The stolen _Dragon's Claw_ manual was only on the second shelf. He hadn't even mastered the Dragon's Claw, so how could he practice the Flower-Plucking Finger, and why go to such lengths to get it?

The second problem was, even if he did take the book, how would he have returned it? By jumping up and stuffing it back? He was barely literate, so how would he remember where it belonged? Looking at the densely packed shelves, Liaojing dismissed the possibility.

Who, then, had read this book? Right under his nose... He started pondering this question after handing the book to the borrowing monk.

The next day, during the routine cleaning, he arrived at the scripture repository early and watched as Ming Buxiang walked into the Repository of Divine Arts.

Just as when Bu Gui was alive, the Repository of Divine Arts had become Ming Buxiang's exclusive cleaning area.

Liaojing watched Ming Buxiang's back. From the doorway, he could only see a small section of the repository; the spot where the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ was kept was just out of his line of sight.

He walked over and passed through the small iron gate. Ming Buxiang was sweeping the floor. He simply nodded upon seeing him, which counted as a bow, and continued with his work.

"You know that the books in here are not to be read, correct?" Liaojing asked.

Ming Buxiang nodded. "Disciples below the rank of Hall Monk are not permitted to read the martial arts manuals in the Repository of Divine Arts. I understand."

"You are young and may not know better, and you love to read. I was worried you might accidentally break the rules," Liaojing said.

"Thank you for your concern, Martial Uncle," Ming Buxiang replied.

After Liaojing left, Ming Buxiang quickly scanned his surroundings, his gaze finally resting on a spot on the upper shelf.

It was where the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ had been.

That afternoon, after the sweeping monks had left, Liaojing's doubts remained. He hoped he was just overthinking it, but he couldn't figure out how the missing page of the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ had been returned to its proper place. Could he have, by chance, inserted it in the exact right spot with a single casual motion?

He looked up, and Ming Buxiang was walking over.

"Borrowing books again?" Liaojing asked.

But Ming Buxiang was fidgeting and seemed hesitant to speak, a stark contrast to his usual calm demeanor. Noticing his strange behavior, Liaojing asked, "What is it?"

Ming Buxiang said, "If someone were to secretly read the scriptures in the Repository of Divine Arts, what would be the punishment?"

Liaojing replied, "That would depend on the situation. In serious cases, they could be expelled from the temple, or end up like Bu Gui... well, you know. If it was just an accidental glance and they didn't read much, the punishment could be a reprimand, caning, or assignment to hard labor."

"I secretly read a manual," Ming Buxiang confessed. "It was the Flower-Plucking Finger Art."

Liaojing was greatly surprised by Ming Buxiang's honesty. "Do you realize this is a major offense?"

"Please take me to the Hall of Upright Action to receive my punishment, Martial Uncle," Ming Buxiang said with his head bowed, seemingly in repentance.

Liaojing asked again, "You have always been one to follow the rules. Why would you read this book?"

Ming Buxiang explained, "Three months ago, I borrowed the _Sutra of the Great Brahma King's Questions to the Buddha_. It told the story of the Buddha's flower-plucking smile. I pondered its meaning but could never understand it. While cleaning, I saw the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ and without thinking, I took the book down. Just as I opened it, I saw a page had fallen out. I quickly tucked the loose page back into the book and put it away."

Liaojing asked, "You didn't read the contents?"

Ming Buxiang hesitated for a moment, then said, "Actually, I did read a few pages."

Liaojing said, "It is said you have a photographic memory. Does this not mean you have learned it?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "Although I remember it, I do not understand it. If Martial Uncle wishes to hear which pages they were, I can recite them for you."

The Flower-Plucking Finger was an upper-hall martial art, and Liaojing couldn't help but feel a flicker of curiosity. He was about to say yes when a thought stopped him.

'This is a high-level martial art. If I accidentally remember it, it might stir my own curiosity, and I might be tempted to read it myself.'

He quickly said, "That won't be necessary." He then asked, "Why did you come to me to confess today?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "Martial Uncle asked me about it this morning, and I suspected I couldn't hide it any longer. I have been feeling uneasy these past few days, so I decided to confess."

With that, the matter of the loose page was resolved.

"I will let it go this time. I will be keeping a close eye on you from now on. Do not do it again."

Ming Buxiang bowed. "I will never do it again."

Liaojing nodded. "That's all, you may go."

Was it really such a coincidence? The moment his suspicion arose, Ming Buxiang came to confess? Although Liaojing found it strange, he thought that Ming Buxiang was only fourteen or fifteen and had no master to guide him. Even if he had read the Flower-Plucking Finger Art, it was impossible for him to have learned it.

He sat in a daze for the rest of the afternoon. When the scripture repository closed and the guard monks came up, he skipped his evening meal. He went to the Fragrant Buddha House in the Buddha Capital, bought a few vegetarian rice dumplings, and went to visit his old master.

Liaojing's master was no ordinary person; he was the abbot of the Hall of True Speech, which controlled all the political affairs of the temple, Abbot Jueru, one of the leading figures among the orthodox monks, nicknamed the _Laughing Buddha_.

But Liaojing knew his master's true nature. If there wasn't a knife hidden behind that smile, how could he have teamed up with the _Inside Blade_ for a double-bladed assault, stirring up such a storm over changing the secular monks' names?

"So kind of you to come and see me. Are you sure you're not here to extort some martial art from me?" In the abbot's room in the Hall of True Speech, Jueru laughed as he ate a vegetarian rice dumpling.

"Master, you've misunderstood me again. This is a token of my filial piety," said Liaojing. "It was your birthday last month."

"Oh, something from last month? I'd forgotten all about it if you hadn't mentioned it," Jueru teased.

"You'd never forget. The gifts started piling up into a mountain two months ago. Plenty of people are eager to flatter you, so I didn't join the crowd and waited a month to come."

"I thought as much. If I actually tried to teach you martial arts, you'd be too lazy to learn anyway," Jueru said. "I already sent you to the Hall of True Insight to be a cataloging monk, which is about as idle a post as one can get. Have you been concentrating on your sutras and practicing your martial arts diligently? Have your skills grown rusty? Come, spar a few rounds with your master."

"That's quite alright. Master, save your energy, and your disciple will suffer fewer bruises."

"You're just lazy. If you were a bit more serious, I'd have another helper on my hands."

"I have more than enough senior brothers, and they can all lend a hand. Besides, only through freedom from desire can one clarify the mind and see their true nature."

"Do you know why I stopped taking disciples after you?" Jueru asked. "It's because I placed all my hopes in you."

"Seventh Senior Brother said you told him the same thing," Liaojing replied. "You also told Eldest Senior Brother he was a man of great potential and that taking him as your only disciple was enough."

Jueru burst into laughter. "Enough with the clever talk. You'll never attain Buddhahood like that."

"If I can't, I'll just return to secular life. Has anything interesting happened lately?"

"What else could there be? It's always those secular monks causing trouble." At the mention of secular monks, Jueru put down the vegetarian rice dumpling he had just unwrapped. "Bringing all sorts of unclean things in here."

"What's wrong?" Liaojing unwrapped a vegetarian rice dumpling and put it in his mouth. Finding it a bit dry, he poured some tea and washed it down, only to be scalded by the hot water.

"Drink slower, or you'll burn yourself to death!"

Jueru continued, "You know about the one who hanged himself in the Hall of Upright Action, right?"

"I heard about it. What of it?"

"What else could it be? Do you know what the cause of death was listed as? Suspected suicide over love!"

"In the temple? Hmm... that is a bit strange. But, alas, it's not the first time I've heard of such a thing."

"How could an autopsy possibly determine the cause was suicide over love?"

"Did he leave a suicide note, or was it based on his relationships?"

"No suicide note, no relationships. The two words 'for love' were right inside his anus."

The term referred to his rear, and upon hearing this, Liaojing understood immediately. But there were no women in the temple, and a preference for men was not unheard of. He asked again, "Do they know who the other person was?"

It was almost certainly Benyue."

"Spotted Dog?" He thought for a moment. "He certainly has a strong stomach."

"Juejian flew into a terrible rage over this matter. He said it was fortunate they sent Ming Buxiang away, to avoid him being tainted by such filth."

The moment he heard Ming Buxiang's name, Liaojing's ears perked up. He asked, "How did this get tangled up with Ming Buxiang?"

"This Ming Buxiang was originally serving his labor duty in the Hall of Upright Action, along with Benyue and that Fu Yingcong who died. Juejian treated him like a treasure, praising him to everyone until we were all sick of hearing it. He even mentioned that he had once given Ming Buxiang a pair of shoes, but Ming Buxiang turned around and gave them to Bu Gui. It's a shame that Bu Gui went astray. Juejian even went to enlighten him personally because of this."

"He was the one who gave Bu Gui the shoes?" Liaojing exclaimed. As a cataloging monk, he was quite familiar with the group of disciples in the Hall of True Insight. After the incident with Bu Gui, he had asked the other disciples what had happened and had a general idea of the cause and effect. It was that pair of shoes, whose origin Bu Gui would never reveal, that had led the cleaning disciples to suspect him of stealing money.

First Bu Gui, then Fu Yingcong; it was quite a coincidence. Liaojing asked, "Spotted Dog doesn't seem the type to have a preference for men. I suspect Fu Yingcong was deceived by him and then hanged himself in a fit of anger."

Jueru said, "It would be for the best if that were the case. If Benyue forced him, this matter would be far from simple. For it to end with 'suicide over love' suggests they were afraid of what they'd find if they dug deeper and wanted to cover up the scandal."

Liaojing ate another vegetarian rice dumpling and said, "If that were truly the case, Abbot Juejian would never let it rest."

Jueru scolded, "You're eating one after another. Did you buy these for your master or for yourself?"

"Ah, I was so engrossed in listening that my mouth couldn't stay idle."

Jueru rose, went to a cabinet to retrieve some fruits and pastries, and placed them on the table.

"Gnaw on these slowly. If you can't finish them, pack them up and take them back."

"How could I possibly? Ah, what is this? It smells so fragrant." He picked up a piece of cake and asked.

Jueru said, "Osmanthus and chestnut cake. It was sent over last month."

Liaojing knew they were all top-quality gifts. It was indeed soft, fragrant, and sweet in his mouth. After offering a few words of praise, he asked, "And what happened after that?"

"Benyue's master, Liaowu, pleaded with Abbot Juejian, hoping to settle the matter as quickly as possible. Benyue has been moved outside the temple to await next year's martial trial."

Liaojing thought for a moment and said, "So that's how it is." As he spoke, he picked up another pastry.

Jueru complained, "You're both of the 'Liao' generation. Liaozheng has already become the head of the Hall of True Contemplation, and all you care about is eating."

The master and disciple chatted idly for a while longer until drowsiness set in, and only then did Liaojing return to his room.

That had happened last June.

The next few months passed without incident. After the start of winter, Ming Buxiang went missing for several days during a snowstorm, which sent Juejian into such a panic that he dispatched all the disciples from the Hall of Upright Action to search for him. Later, it was heard that Ming Buxiang had resolved a long-standing feud between the blacksmith Yao Yunda at the foot of the mountain and his enemy. Abbot Jueming was greatly impressed and made him one of the In-Hall Laymen. To become an In-Hall Layman before the age of sixteen was remarkable; Jueming personally assigned someone to teach him martial arts, and it was said his progress was a thousand miles a day.

A boy in his teens had persuaded two adults to turn weapons of war into gifts of jade and silk?

'This Junior Brother Ming is truly clever,' Liaojing thought.

But a faint unease lingered in his heart; the page that had fallen from the _Flower-Plucking Finger Art_ manual constantly weighed on his mind.

From every perspective, Ming Buxiang was impeccable: intelligent, diligent, kind, and humble. But starting with Liaoxin, then Bu Gui, Lü Changfeng, the disciples of the Hall of True Insight, and Fu Yingcong... those connected with him always seemed to meet with misfortune.

After the New Year, Liaojing heard another piece of news.

Benyue had gone mad in the Buddha Capital and gouged out his own eyes.

'Is it Benyue's turn now?' Liaojing thought. He discussed the matter with his master, Jueru. Everyone said Benyue couldn't bear the torment of his conscience, which was why he had gone mad, but Liaojing said, "If Spotted Dog had a conscience, he wouldn't be Spotted Dog."

In March, as the snow began to melt, Liaojing threw on an outer robe and went to the Buddha Capital.

He arrived at Benyue's residence in the Buddha Capital, a small hut with two monks standing guard outside. Liaojing greeted the monks, saying he wished to see Benyue.

"You want to see Spotted Dog?" one of the monks asked. "What for?"

Liaojing replied, "I've met him a few times. Consider it a visit of concern."

Liaojing was only twenty-seven, but he was a monk of the 'Liao' generation. The Shaolin Temple had a vast number of disciples ranked by generation, and the disparities were immense; it was common to have high seniority at a young age. The guarding monks were merely of the 'Ben' generation and did not obstruct him much, only saying, "Be careful he doesn't lash out and hurt you."

Liaojing nodded, pushed open the door, and immediately heard Benyue's panicked, beast-like roars.

Benyue's eyes were sunken hollows, reportedly self-inflicted. Hearing the door open, he roared wildly, "Don't come near me! Don't come near me!"

Liaojing frowned and stepped forward.

Hearing footsteps, Benyue didn't waste words and struck out with a Thousand-Hand Guanyin Palm. In his madness, his strength was immense, and the palm strike whistled through the air. Liaojing dodged to the side and extended a leg to trip him. Benyue immediately sprang back up and began swinging and striking wildly without regard for his surroundings.

'If I let him carry on like this, he's bound to injure his muscles and bones,' Liaojing thought. He put forth both hands, executing the Left and Right Flower-Weaving Hands.

The Left and Right Flower-Weaving Hands technique emphasized using the ephemeral to neutralize the substantial, centered on the four principles of "divide, turn, deflect, and strike."

"Divide" referred to splitting the force; when an opponent threw a punch, one would strike its middle flow at the elbow or arm to disperse its power. "Turn" was to rotate the arm, as if drawing a circle, to change the direction of the opponent's attack. After these two stages, the power of the opponent's attack would be greatly reduced, followed by "deflect," using one's posture and arms to shed the remaining force, and finally, counterattacking. Its martial principles were similar to Wudang's Cloud Hands, both using circular motions to neutralize an opponent's power.

At that moment, Liaojing had no intention of causing harm. He simply swept and partitioned with his hands, blocking and parrying, until Benyue's flurry of palm shadows was completely dissipated. Before long, Benyue collapsed to the ground, exhausted.

'I haven't fought in so long, yet my martial arts have actually improved,' Liaojing thought. 'Master is always scolding me for not being diligent, but I'm still capable.'

Then another thought occurred to him, and he imagined his master saying, "You're proud of defeating a 'Ben' generation monk?"

He supposed that was true; Benyue was just a labor disciple, and beating him was nothing to brag about. But not only had he won with ease, he had completely exhausted him, which was not so simple. Then he thought, 'Speaking of which, Master would probably call me arrogant for this. Aih, it seems no matter what I do, Master will never be satisfied.'

After his thoughts had wandered for a moment, he looked back at Benyue and asked in a low voice, "What did you see?"

Benyue was gasping for breath. Hearing Liaojing approach, he shrank into a corner in terror, sobbing, "I didn't see anything... I didn't see anything, don't come over here..."

Considering Spotted Dog's past villainy, seeing him in his current state, should one say it was a trace of satisfaction within pity, or a trace of pity within satisfaction? Liaojing lowered his head and said, "I won't harm you. I only ask, what did you see?"

No matter how Liaojing questioned him, Benyue only spoke nonsense, panicked and distraught, crying with his head in his hands. Unable to get any answers, Liaojing felt frustrated for a moment and thought he might as well fight fire with fire and test him.

"I am Ming Buxiang. Spotted Dog, you dared to bully me, and now I've come for revenge!" Liaojing altered his voice, deliberately mentioning Ming Buxiang's name.

Benyue merely twitched, then roared, "You bastard, one day I'll kill you, kill you! Come here, I'll kill you!"

His hatred for Ming Buxiang was palpable and certain, but hearing the name did not cause any particular panic. Could it be that he was just overthinking things?

Liaojing lowered his voice again, making it ghostly. "I am Fu Yingcong. Give me back my life!"

Upon hearing Fu Yingcong's name, Benyue instantly leaped up in terror, shouting, "Fu Yingcong, stay away from me! You're dead, so just be dead! Stop! Don't! Don't touch me!"

He shrank into the corner, wrapping his arms around his shoulders, hugging himself so tightly his fingertips nearly dug into his flesh.

He could be heard crying and shouting, "I did what you wanted, I dug out my eyes to repay you, what more do you want, what more do you want?"

Liaojing felt a pang of pity. 'It seems Fu Yingcong was indeed forced to his death by Benyue. His conscience is troubling him, giving him nightmares day and night, and that's what drove him mad. This man has committed many evils and deserves to die.'

He stood up, about to leave, when he noticed again the way Benyue was huddled in the corner, arms wrapped around his shoulders. At first glance, it just seemed he was terrified, hiding in the corner. But on closer inspection, it was different. When a person hugs themselves in fear, their hands would normally rest on the lower part of their shoulders, the most natural position for an embrace. Benyue's hands, however, were pressed on the upper part of his shoulders, his knees were bent, and his upper body was leaning back, as if trying his utmost to press his torso against the corner rather than curling into a ball.

An idea struck him. He walked over, pulled Benyue's hands away, and tore open his clothes. On Benyue's shoulder were five bruises, marks from where he himself had gripped his own shoulder with excessive force, causing the blood to pool. Looking at the other shoulder, there were identical finger marks in the same place. The moment his hand touched the bruises, Benyue jumped up, yelling, "Don't grab my shoulders, don't grab my shoulders!"

'If one only looked at this position,' Liaojing thought, 'it looks like during intercourse, the person on the bottom is grabbing the shoulders of the person on top.'

He had a sudden realization and said in a ghastly, spectral voice, "I am Fu Yingcong, and I've come to grab your shoulders!"

Benyue fell to his knees, begging for mercy, clutching his shoulders and kowtowing nonstop until his head bled, wailing, "Don't grab me! Don't grab me! Go get your revenge on Ming Buxiang! I was trying to get him, not you, who knew you would be there? Who knew!"

Hearing Ming Buxiang's name again, Liaojing quickly pressed for more, but Benyue's words were muddled and incoherent, and everything he said revolved around Fu Yingcong.

Liaojing left the small hut and asked the two monks at the door how Benyue would be dealt with.

The monks replied, "His family has been notified. If they do not come to claim him, he will be imprisoned in the Shaolin Temple."

Liaojing nodded and left Benyue's residence.

Benyue had set a trap, intending to assault Ming Buxiang, but somehow, Fu Yingcong had ended up being the scapegoat. Fu Yingcong, unable to bear the humiliation, hanged himself; Abbot Juejian's assessment was correct. To protect his disciple, Liaowu had First Seat Juekong step in and save him.

This could all be confirmed by simply asking Liaowu. However, Liaowu was a secular monk and a subordinate of "Brocade Lion" Jueji. The Brocade Lion had always been on bad terms with his master, Jueru, and his master had recently joined forces with that "Inside Blade" to propose a name change for secular monks. If he were to ask now, wouldn't it raise suspicions that he wanted to reopen an old case? It was better to do some digging himself.

He made inquiries at the nearby shops and learned from an apothecary that Benyue had come a few days before his breakdown to buy ointment for bruises.

"I asked him where he was injured, but he wouldn't say, just that he wanted to buy some, and the best kind at that," the apothecary owner said.

"How did he seem at the time?" Liaojing asked.

"A bit distracted," the apothecary owner said. "I'd never seen him like that before."

"Before?" Liaojing asked. "Owner, you know Benyue?"

"Before he went mad, he got into a fight at the Chan Wind Teahouse. The other party threatened to report him to the Nameless Temple, so he had to pay up and bring the man here for medicine. At the time, he was still muttering about how after he received his Writ of Chivalry, he would go to Jiangxi to taste a real woman. I knew he was a secular monk at a glance. It's a good thing he looks the way he does and acts so vilely, otherwise, with all the customers I have, how would I remember him?"

"How long ago was that?" Liaojing asked, a deep suspicion growing in his heart.

"About three months ago, I'd say."

At that time, Benyue had not yet gone mad, and Fu Yingcong was already dead, yet he showed no sign of guilt. How did his inner demons suddenly run rampant? Did his fear grow the more he thought about it? He himself didn't believe Benyue had much of a conscience, and it was only after seeing him go mad that he thought perhaps his guilty conscience had conjured demons. But now, hearing the apothecary owner's account, it didn't seem to be the case.

The bruises on Benyue's shoulders were indeed self-inflicted, but it was because he didn't want to be grabbed by a ghost. That was the spot where Fu Yingcong had grabbed his shoulders, trying to push him away, during the assault.

He also asked the nearby residents if any strange people had been seen around when Benyue went mad, but they all said no. Only one person mentioned seeing a figure flash past Benyue's house one day, like a ghost.

What if someone had pretended to be a ghost to frighten Benyue and drive him mad? Benyue was a bold person; just pretending to be a ghost wouldn't have scared him. How did the other person do it? Benyue had bought medicine for bruises before he went mad. If the bruises on his shoulders were not self-inflicted, then who made them?

That position was near the front; trying to press there would inevitably be noticed. Even if that person's movement technique was incredibly fast, the room was small, leaving no room to dodge or maneuver, unless it was a finger strike from a distance. But what kind of martial art could cause a bruise without the injured person even noticing?

The Flower-Plucking Finger Art! It could strike an opponent with formless finger energy, leaving the victim completely unaware!

Liaojing's heart skipped a beat, and he turned and walked back towards the Shaolin Temple.

Someone had used the Flower-Plucking Finger Art, taking advantage of a moment when Benyue was not paying attention, to create bruises on his shoulders with finger force from a distance. When Benyue was washing, he saw the marks on his body and believed it was Fu Yingcong's ghost coming for revenge. Plagued by anxiety day and night, the person then dressed as a ghost to frighten him, forcing him to gouge out his own eyes.

That was why the maddened Benyue desperately held his own shoulders. The bruises he made himself, in turn, concealed the injuries caused by the Flower-Plucking Finger Art.

Although the details were unclear, this was the most likely scenario.

If such a person existed, could it be Ming Buxiang?

Could a teenager have mastered an advanced temple art like the Flower-Plucking Finger Art to such a profound level, even using it to toy with Benyue?

Even more terrifying was the cunning...

If it was true... if it was really true...

Liaojing was rife with suspicion, but he had no proof.

※ ※ ※

First Seat Jueguan arrived at the Unique Wisdom Court; this "Inside Blade" had come to visit Abbot Jueming. At the same time, he had invited Abbot Juejian of the Hall of Upright Action.

During the Four Courts' joint council, only these two orthodox monks had opposed the renaming of secular monks. He wanted to persuade the two of them, but he had little confidence. Jueming was well-read in the classics and believed renaming secular monks was a discriminatory act. However, if he could persuade Juejian, then according to Jueming's "Not a Single Leaf Clings" personality, he would definitely change his stance. But Juejian had always been pragmatic and believed it was not the time to add fuel to the fire of the conflict between orthodox and secular monks; persuading him would not be easy.

Just as Jueguan was pondering how to persuade Jueming, a young man bumped into him head-on. Jueguan was a First Seat of the Four Courts, so his martial arts were naturally exceptional. He took a step back and steadied the young man, saying, "Be careful."

The young man, having nearly run into someone, steadied himself and hurriedly bowed. "Disciple Ming Buxiang greets First Seat Jueguan. I beg the First Seat's forgiveness."

Jueguan had often heard Juejian and Jueming mention this disciple and knew he was the newly promoted In-Hall Layman who helped Jueming with official documents and records. He had never paid him much mind before, but seeing him today, he was indeed a handsome youth. He asked, "So you are Ming Buxiang? Have you seen Abbot Juejian?"

"Abbot Juejian just arrived." After speaking, he let out a big yawn, and realizing his impoliteness, quickly lowered his head. "Disciple has lost his composure."

Jueguan smiled. "Didn't get enough sleep last night?"

Ming Buxiang smiled faintly and said, "I was reading the sutras yesterday, and there was a very frightening story that scared me so much I tossed and turned all night, feeling deeply uneasy. That's why I bumped into the First Seat."

Jueguan's curiosity was piqued. "What kind of story was so frightening?"

Ming Buxiang said, "Yesterday I was reading the _Mahaparinirvana Sutra_ and got to the seventh scroll. I was terrified."

This sentence was like a sudden enlightenment for Jueguan.

The _Mahaparinirvana Sutra_ records the teachings given by the Buddha before he entered nirvana, and the content of the seventh chapter is as follows:

"The Buddha told Kāśyapa: Seven hundred years after my Parinirvāṇa, the demon Pāpīyān will gradually corrupt my true Dharma. Like a hunter who wears the robes of the Dharma, the demon king Pāpīyān will do the same, taking the form of a bhikṣu, a bhikṣuṇī, an upāsaka, or an upāsikā. He will also transform into the body of a Srotāpanna, and even into the body of an Arhat and the form of a Buddha. The demon king will use this tainted form to create a flawless body and destroy my true Dharma."

The meaning is that the Buddha said that seven hundred years after his death, the demon king would disguise himself as a monk and use false Buddhist teachings to destroy the true Dharma.

Some have condensed this sentence into eight short words: "In the Dharma-ending age, use the Buddha to destroy the Buddha."

"I have often heard the two abbots praise you, and they were not wrong," Jueguan patted Ming Buxiang on the shoulder and smiled. "Good child!"

Ming Buxiang asked, "Does the First Seat require this disciple to lead the way?"

Jueguan smiled. "No need, this Seat knows the way."

Jueguan strode quickly into the hall. He now knew how to convince Juejian and Jueming.

These secular monks, just like the demon king's disciples recorded in the classics, were wearing the kasaya of the Sangha Jewel while doing things that destroyed the Buddhist Dharma. The Shaolin Temple was a sacred place of Buddhism and a benchmark. If one day even the position of abbot was taken by a secular monk, it would not only destroy the Shaolin Temple but could very well be a catastrophe for Buddhism. The distinction between orthodox and secular could be disregarded, the rise and fall of the Shaolin Temple could be disregarded, but the Dharma could not. Allowing these people to occupy the Shaolin Temple was tantamount to giving them the right to speak for the Dharma.

A distinction had to be made; secular monks must not use the same titles as orthodox monks. Approaching from this angle, he believed he could certainly convince Juejian and Jueming.

'All thanks to this child,' Jueguan thought.

※ ※ ※

Liaojing looked up and saw Ming Buxiang, who was returning two sutras he had borrowed a few days ago.

They were the _Mahaparinirvana Sutra_ and the _Śūraṅgama Sūtra_.

Previously, Liaojing had rarely spoken with Ming Buxiang, but today he initiated the conversation.

"These two sutras are quite interesting, aren't they?" He picked up the _Mahaparinirvana Sutra_ and said, "This book has a story about how, after the Buddha entered nirvana, heavenly demons disguised themselves as the Buddha's disciples, infiltrated the Buddhist order, and destroyed the true Dharma."

Ming Buxiang said, "It is recorded in the seventh scroll, I remember."

Liaojing then picked up the _Śūraṅgama Sūtra_. "As for this _Śūraṅgama Sūtra_, since its appearance, many have claimed it is a forgery, simply because the content is so miraculous as to be unbelievable. Many eminent monks and laymen have debated this book time and again."

Liaojing looked at Ming Buxiang and asked, "Do you think the _Śūraṅgama Sūtra_ is real or fake?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "The ancients debated it many times but could never produce evidence to prove it is fake."

Liaojing said, "I, on the other hand, think it is fake. It's just that the proof has not yet been found." He stared intently at Ming Buxiang and asked in return, "What do you say?"

Ming Buxiang did not answer, only offering Liaojing a faint smile, as brilliant as a flower blooming in early spring.

**Translator's Note**

"Returning to lay life" (huan su) means formally renouncing one's status as a monk.

That means the person would no longer shave their head.

They would become a "lay disciple" (sujia dizi), someone affiliated with the Shaolin Temple who learns its martial arts and serves its interests, but lives as a commoner without being bound by strict monastic rules.

Juekong is sarcastically suggesting: _If you orthodox monks hate us "secular monks" so much, why don't we just stop pretending to be monks and serve Shaolin as regular laymen instead?_

The proposal is impossible due to a strict administrative rule that creates a "Catch-22" scenario.

Non-monks cannot enter the Halls." The "Halls" (the Four Courts and Eight Halls) are the government and management departments of Shaolin. To hold a position in these departments—whether as a lowly clerk or a high-ranking First Seat—you must be an ordained monk with a shaved head.

The temple relies entirely on these "secular" men to run the business, politics, and daily operations (because the "orthodox" monks are too busy meditating).

If these managers "return to lay life," they are no longer monks.

If they are not monks, the rule says they get kicked out of the Halls.

To continue doing their jobs (managing the temple), they would have to immediately re-ordain and shave their heads again to satisfy the "enter the Halls" rule.

If the entire administration of the monastery were turned over to lay disciples (people who are not monks), "could it still be called a 'Temple'?" A temple run entirely by laymen loses its religious identity.
