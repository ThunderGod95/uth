# Chapter 11: The Profligate Patron

Kunlun Year 85, autumn, the eighth month.

Yang Yan entered the city and knocked on the blacksmith’s door under the cover of night. The blacksmith opened the door holding a candle, cursing, “Who in the blazes is looking for an early grave, keeping people from their sleep!”

Upon a closer look, in the mingled light of candle and moon, he saw Yang Yan’s mouth covered in scars and his eyes blood-red; the smith was so startled the candle nearly slipped from his hand.

Yang Yan walked straight into the smithy to find a weapon. The blacksmith, sensing something was amiss, asked, “Young Master Yang, what has happened?”

Yang Yan did not answer, first choosing a sword that did not sit well in his hand, then picking another, slightly thinner one. As the blacksmith came forward to ask again, Yang Yan pulled several taels of silver from his robes—it was all the money he could find at home—and after selecting a piece of broken silver and setting it down, he left the smithy.

The blacksmith stood stunned for a moment before he heard his wife call from inside, “Who is it?”

“It’s nothing!” the blacksmith replied. He closed the door, a feeling of unease settling in his heart.

Carrying the sword, Yang Yan recalled the black-robed man’s northern accent and so headed north.

The estate workers were wondering why Yang Zhengde and Qin Jiuxian had not shown up for work for two straight days when news of the Yang family’s massacre spread through the city. It turned out the blacksmith had paid a visit to the Yang residence that morning, and upon his return, had spread the news and notified the chief of the Beggar's Sect's Chongren branch.

Yang Zhengde had always been on good terms with everyone, so upon hearing the news, the community was enraged; remembering that Qin Jiuxian had disappeared at the same time, they immediately grew suspicious and gathered a crowd to go to his residence, only to find the place deserted. His neighbors said only that Qin Jiuxian had left the previous night and never returned; all they knew was that he was originally from Linchuan, and nothing more, which made the crowd even more suspicious. The local Beggar's Sect steward, Pi Lai, sent a report of the massacre up the chain of command, naming Qin Jiuxian as the suspect and initiating a manhunt, but made no inquiries as to Yang Yan’s whereabouts.

Yang Yan left the city, asking for directions along the way. But he was carrying a weapon, his appearance was frightful, and his cheeks were covered in injuries; whenever he spoke, the movement tugged at the wounds on his cheeks and tongue, making his voice sound strange and causing passersby to shrink away from him. He finally chanced upon a kind-hearted aunty who took pity on him, listened to him speak, and showed him concern, but Yang Yan would only ask for directions and refused to answer any other questions. The aunty could only tell him that Linchuan lay to the north along the main road, but she had not seen the black-robed man he described.

Chongren County was only a few dozen li from Linchuan. It was said that Fuzhou was seven parts mountains, one part water, and two parts fields; though he traveled the post road built by the Beggar's Sect, the terrain was still rugged. Yang Yan just kept walking, searching for water whenever he was thirsty, until at noon he was suddenly struck by a wave of dizziness; he had not eaten all day and was faint with hunger. He then remembered that he had brought money for his journey but no rations, and seeing a rustic tavern in the distance, he headed toward it.

Inside the tavern, several travelers turned to look at him. By now, Yang Yan’s wounds were festering and would bleed uncontrollably at the touch of hot food, so he bought several cold buns for the road. Each time he chewed, the movement pulled at the injuries on his cheeks and gums, a pain like the scraping of a knife or the piercing of a needle, forcing him to wash the food down whole with water.

With his rations prepared and a waterskin bought from the innkeeper and filled with water, he continued on his way. He had not been walking for half a shichen when a heavy blow suddenly struck the back of his head; before he could even process what was happening, several ruffians were punching and kicking him to the ground, their hands already reaching into his robes for his money pouch. Yang Yan desperately clutched the embroidered pincushion inside his robes, gripping it so tightly that he pierced his own palm and fingers until they bled. The robbers could not pry his fingers open and, fearing someone might come along, hastily snatched only the money pouch and the token before fleeing. Yang Yan struggled to his feet and recognized the retreating figures as the travelers from the tavern; knowing he could not catch them, he limped onward toward Linchuan.

When night fell, Yang Yan used his sword to cut some cogon grass to serve as a bed and blanket, sleeping rough by the side of the road; fortunately, he was not disturbed by poisonous snakes or wild beasts. After walking like this for two days, he finally reached the city of Linchuan at noon on the third day.

After the Kunlun council, the Beggar's Sect’s influence extended over the three provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi, with Fuzhou serving as Jiangxi's major stronghold—in its early years, the sect was a gathering of beggars, and most of its members were illiterate martial practitioners, so successive leaders made it their mission to promote culture and learning. Linchuan had long enjoyed a reputation as the “land of scholars,” which was why the Jiangxi provincial branch was established there. Naturally, for the same reason, Shaoxing in Zhejiang became the site of the Beggar’s Sect headquarters.

Having traveled dozens of li in two days, Yang Yan was exhausted and his entire body ached. His wounds, left untreated and exposed to the filth he slept in, had begun to breed maggots that crawled all over his face, causing the city folk to recoil at the sight of him. He looked all around but naturally did not see his enemy; he passed a large courtyard and heard the sound of an argument, but was in no mood to pay it any mind. With a sidelong glance, he caught a glimpse of a familiar back in an alleyway; just as he was about to hurry forward, the world suddenly spun and he collapsed.

“You liar, you scoundrel! Ah… someone’s fainted!”

This was the last thing he heard before he lost consciousness.

***

When he opened his eyes again, the first thing Yang Yan saw was a person’s back.

It was the back of an old man.

Yang Yan immediately reached for the embroidered pincushion in his robes; feeling it still there, his heart settled, and he began to look for his sword.

Where was his sword? Yang Yan could not help but cry out, but only a groan escaped his lips.

The old man turned and hurried over to soothe him, saying, “Don’t move around. Just rest.”

As Yang Yan struggled to look around the room, the old man asked, “What are you looking for?” Realizing, he then pulled the sword out from under the bed. “Is this what you’re looking for?”

Yang Yan snatched the sword and clutched it tightly; he was about to speak when the old man pressed a hand to his chest and said, “Shh, don’t talk. Your tongue is injured, so speak less and rest more.”

Yang Yan shook his head; he hugged the sword and tried to get up, but his body was weak and aching all over.

Suddenly, with a creak, the door opened, and a young woman entered carrying a bowl of medicinal soup. She was about seventeen, with a plump figure; though shorter than Yang Yan, she looked to be heavier.

The old man helped Yang Yan sit up. “My surname is Sun, and I am a physician. This is my granddaughter, Ah Zhu.” Hearing that the man was a physician, Yang Yan realized that medicine had already been applied to his face.

“Don’t move, I’ll feed you,” Ah Zhu said, proceeding to give him the medicine one spoonful at a time. Looking at Ah Zhu, Yang Yan was reminded of the faint smile on Yang Shanshan’s face before she died; his eyes suddenly reddened, and he struggled to cry out, “Sister…”

His pronunciation was unclear, and Ah Zhu misheard it as “thanks.” “No need for thanks,” she said quickly. “It’s the right thing to do.”

Yang Yan suppressed his emotions and reached for his money, only to remember that he had been robbed of everything. Doctor Sun saw his expression and guessed the situation. “I don’t know what happened to you, nor do I intend to pry, but your eyes…” He paused, then continued, “You were too gravely injured and didn’t receive timely treatment, which has allowed the affliction to take root. It’s inevitable that you’ll have scars on your face and that your speech will be impaired, but your life is not in danger. Whatever unfinished business you may have, if it is inconvenient to speak of, it can all wait until you’ve recovered.”

This was the first time Yang Yan had received kindness from anyone since the calamity that befell his family a few days prior, and a wave of warmth spread through his heart. He was in no mood to recover, however; he only wanted to find his enemy and take revenge as soon as possible.

“You should rest well,” said Doctor Sun. “We won’t disturb you.”

Yang Yan slept again. His wounds were ulcerated and inflamed, and his entire body ached with the slightest movement; over the course of a day’s recuperation, his condition fluctuated, and he drifted in and out of consciousness.

When he awoke the next day, Doctor Sun was brewing medicine. Seeing him up, he asked, “How are you?” Yang Yan was completely drained of strength. Doctor Sun took his pulse, and as he did, Yang Yan noticed a bruise on the doctor’s face and pointed at it. Doctor Sun said it was nothing. Yang Yan was suspicious. Just then, Ah Zhu came in with a bundle and asked, “Is this yours?”

Yang Yan looked and saw that the bundle contained the broken silver and the token that had been stolen from him two days ago, making him even more confused.

“Where did you find this?” Doctor Sun asked. “It was just left at our doorstep,” said Ah Zhu. “No idea who delivered it.”

Yang Yan pointed at the silver, then at Doctor Sun. The doctor understood his meaning, weighed a small piece of silver in his hand, and said, “I’ll just take this for the cost of the medicine. You can keep the rest.” Yang Yan was deeply grateful but still had no idea how the token and silver had been returned.

After Doctor Sun left the room, Yang Yan pointed at his own face and then toward the door, asking Ah Zhu without words how her grandfather had been injured.

Seeing Yang Yan’s question, Ah Zhu pouted and said angrily, “A charlatan came to the city. He’s a bully, too! Not only did he steal a patient, he even hurt my grandfather.”

Curious, Yang Yan pointed at Ah Zhu and made a gesture as if to speak, bidding her to elaborate.

It turned out that Doctor Sun was a renowned and benevolent physician in the city who healed the sick and injured, often charging the poor only for the cost of his materials, with most of his income coming from treating the family of the wealthy Master Zhu.

About a month ago, Master Zhu’s newly-wed concubine had suddenly fallen gravely ill, complaining of chest tightness and shortness of breath that tormented her day and night, preventing her from sharing a bed with her husband. Master Zhu was anxious and summoned Doctor Sun, but after a long period of treatment, the physician still couldn’t get to the root of the problem.

Then, about half a month ago, a traveling doctor named Zhu Menshang arrived, claiming that his ancestors had been unscrupulously wealthy and that his master had instructed him to provide free consultations for three years as penance. Thus, he charged nothing for his diagnoses, only for medicine. Hearing of the strange illness of Master Zhu’s concubine, he paid a visit. Master Zhu, desperate enough to try anything, invited him in. After an examination, Zhu Menshang declared that the lady was suffering from an accumulation of yang essence, an incompatibility of yin and yang, and a disharmony of water and fire, which had resulted in a disease of the heart.

Master Zhu asked, "What is an accumulation of yang essence?"

Zhu Menshang then asked, “Master Zhu, when you conduct your affairs, is yin and yang sometimes inverted?”

Embarrassed, Master Zhu said, “Indeed… a few times.”

“I’m afraid it’s been more than just a few times, hasn’t it?” Zhu Menshang said.

Seeing Master Zhu just chuckle sheepishly, Zhu Menshang continued, “Master, you are vigorous and your essence is potent; that is to say, you are too mighty, and your yang energy is too strong. In normal congress, the man is on top and the woman below, allowing the yang energy to enter through the feminine gate and exit through the seven orifices. But you have inverted yin and yang, and the madam cannot bear it. Her body cannot dissipate the yang energy, so it has accumulated within her. To cure this illness, the yang essence must be guided out.”

With that, Zhu Menshang had Madam Zhu stand up and produced a three-foot-long needle, which he maneuvered behind her back. Using such a long needle for treatment was truly unheard of. No one knew which acupoint on her back he inserted it into, but he pinched the needle with his left hand and suddenly slapped his right palm against her chest. The needle abruptly pierced through from her chest. Holding the needle between his hands at her chest and back, he swiftly pulled with his left hand and released with his right, and the needle retracted.

Zhu Menshang said, “I have pierced a hole for the madam to vent the energy, but for a full recovery, she must take my ancestral secret formula. However, the ingredients are not cheap. It will require three taels of silver per dose, taken once in the morning and once at night, to be fully cured.”

Master Zhu was utterly baffled by this divine skill of piercing the chest with a needle. This concubine was his newest and most beloved; never mind six taels of silver a day, he would willingly pay sixty.

Zhu Menshang added a warning, “The madam’s illness arose from congress. If you resume relations before she has fully recovered, I fear her condition will worsen. If the roles are reversed, and you end up accumulating yin energy, I’m afraid…”

“Afraid of what?” Master Zhu asked hurriedly.

Zhu Menshang raised his index finger toward the sky, then hooked it downward.

“Could it… could it cause impotence?” Master Zhu cried in alarm.

Zhu Menshang nodded, and Master Zhu quickly vowed, “I won’t transgress! I absolutely won’t!”

Afterward, Zhu Menshang delivered his medicinal pills, and sure enough, they were effective immediately. Madam Zhu’s health gradually improved, and Master Zhu paid him his silver daily without question.

When Doctor Sun heard of this, he found it utterly preposterous. He told Ah Zhu, “This man is a fraud, a con artist going after a big score. Where in the world is there a principle of three-foot-long acupuncture needles? And what kind of method is there for piercing the chest? It’s a type of trickery. The needle is in two sections. One part, the one people see, is about three feet long, thick at the back and narrow at the front, with a mechanism hidden inside. When he pokes the back, the front end retracts. Then, with the slap on the chest, he conceals the other section of the needle between his fingers, making it look like it has passed through the chest. After being slapped like that, how could the patient distinguish the pain in her chest from the needle poke or the palm strike? As for the medical theory of accumulating yang essence, it’s absolute nonsense, utter nonsense!”

Ah Zhu then asked why Madam Zhu’s condition improved after taking the medicine.

Doctor Sun replied, “That’s a trick of itinerant healers in the martial world, what they call ‘symptom suppression.’ The medicine is often refined from things like mercury and poppy. After taking it, various symptoms might be alleviated for a while, but it doesn’t cure the root cause. Taking more of it is even more harmful to the body.”

Doctor Sun added, “That Zhu Menshang claims he offers his skills for free, but not his medicine. What ingredients could possibly cost three taels of silver per dose? Besides, if he really doesn’t charge money, why isn’t he practicing in his own hometown? Why hasn’t he opened a clinic, instead spending all his days… living in the House of Hundred Fragrances?”

Doctor Sun went to the Zhu residence to plead his case, but the family wouldn’t believe him. He then went to confront Zhu Menshang, but Zhu Menshang just laughed at him. “You won’t make money off the rich marks, instead wasting your effort on the poor folk. No wonder you can’t make a living.” This was more slang of the swindlers of the martial world: the rich were called “fire marks,” the poor “water folk,” and earning money was “making a living.” Doctor Sun was even more certain he was a charlatan, but Master Zhu wouldn't listen and instead accused him of being jealous. It was on that very day that Yang Yan happened to collapse outside Master Zhu’s house and was rescued by Doctor Sun.

Yang Yan thought back; so what he had heard that day was the argument between Doctor Sun and the swindler. It seemed he had collapsed near the Zhu residence.

Ah Zhu then said that her grandfather had gone to the House of Hundred Fragrances again that day to argue with Zhu Menshang, but was shoved aside, hitting a door panel and injuring himself.

At that moment, the thing Yang Yan could least tolerate was hearing about the strong bullying the weak, and a fire of rage ignited within him. He had always been hot-tempered, and the tragedy that had befallen his family was like oil poured on fire.

Suddenly, he heard Doctor Sun’s frantic voice from outside, “What are you doing here?” Then another voice said, “I was thinking about that kid you picked up the other day, so I came to have a look.”

A man walked straight into the room, and Doctor Sun couldn't stop him. Yang Yan looked at the man: he had a long, thin chin, a refined face with a hint of ruggedness, and a particularly striking pair of thick eyebrows. Doctor Sun pulled at the man, saying, “This child has no money, don’t cause trouble!” Ah Zhu tugged at Yang Yan’s sleeve, her eyes signaling that this was Zhu Menshang.

Zhu Menshang looked Yang Yan up and down, then leaned in to sniff at him. Feeling offended, and disgusted by his bullying of Doctor Sun, Yang Yan gripped his sword and cursed, “Get lost!” He slashed with the sword. He had no intention of hurting the man, only wanting to scare him and teach him a small lesson. But he had not yet recovered from his injuries and illness, and the sword strike was wobbly and weak.

Zhu Menshang caught the blade with ease and cursed, “You little bastard, you dare to hurt people!” He was lean and tall, but surprisingly strong. With a pull of his hands, he lifted Yang Yan up. “He’s just a child, and a patient! Don’t hurt him!” Doctor Sun said urgently.

Yang Yan’s feet dangled in the air, and the things in his robes fell to the floor, including the token. Zhu Menshang bent down to pick it up and smiled, “So, he’s a rich mark.” He turned to Doctor Sun. “This patient is mine now.”

“How can you be so unreasonable?” Doctor Sun said, panicked.

“So what if I am? This brat tried to wound me with a sword. I’ll take him to the Beggar’s Sect and see how they judge this!”

“He’s just a child, and he has no money. What do you want with him?” Doctor Sun asked.

Zhu Menshang scoffed, “Hey, you say I’m a fraud? If this kid dies under my care, I’ll pay with my life. If he gets better, you stop going to the Zhu family to trouble me! In your sorry state, how much would you have to spend on his medicine? I’m helping you save money, you ungrateful fool!”

Yang Yan tried to struggle, but his body was weak. Zhu Menshang snatched the sword from his hands and slung him over his shoulder like a sack. His movements were rough, and the sudden motion caused Yang Yan to faint.

Without a backward glance, Zhu Menshang strode away. Doctor Sun and Ah Zhu were powerless to stop him.

***

Yang Yan felt as if he were lying on a cloud of cotton, soft and warm, and he smelled a faint fragrance. He opened his eyes to find himself on a canopied bed, the top decorated with peony patterns and the posts draped with crimson gauze. The room was adorned with vases and jade ornaments, and a delicately carved incense burner sent up curls of blue smoke. He came from a poor family; where would he have ever seen such splendor? For a moment, he felt as if he were in a celestial paradise.

Suddenly, a breeze stirred the gauze curtains, causing them to drift slowly upward. Yang Yan turned his head and saw, through the parting curtains, a slender figure standing before a table, surrounded by a white mist of flying powder.

It was Zhu Menshang, kneading dough.

Kneading dough in such an elegant room was not only jarring but also terribly improper. Yang Yan watched as Zhu Menshang pounded, kneaded, squeezed, stretched, and tossed the dough over and over, and he thought, ‘I wonder what kind of scam he’s plotting now. If this guy wasn’t a swindler, he’d make a decent cook.’

Just as he was about to get up, Zhu Menshang cursed, “Didn’t that old man Sun tell you not to move? You’re like a wild monkey, wriggling around.”

Yang Yan was fiercely proud; he was polite and obedient toward those he respected, but toward those who were crude and whom he disliked, if you told him to go east, he would deliberately go west. He detested Zhu Menshang because of what had happened to Doctor Sun, so when Zhu Menshang told him to lie down, he insisted on getting up.

“What a wild monkey!” Zhu Menshang cursed. He picked up the dough, walked over to Yang Yan, and shoved him back onto the bed. When Yang Yan opened his mouth to curse back, Zhu Menshang tore off a fist-sized piece of dough and stuffed it into his mouth. Yang Yan tried to spit it out, but Zhu Menshang squeezed his cheeks shut and proceeded to stuff more and more dough into his mouth until it was completely full. Yang Yan couldn't breathe properly; unable to swallow or spit, he was so nauseated that snot and tears streamed down his face as he desperately beat at Zhu Menshang. Annoyed, Zhu Menshang pinned his hands with his feet and continued, squeezing and packing until the very last crevice in his mouth was filled.

Unable to struggle and gasping for air, Yang Yan had no choice but to submit. Seeing him subdued, Zhu Menshang molded the remaining dough into a long strip and pressed it evenly along his upper and lower gums before finally letting go.

The moment Zhu Menshang released him, Yang Yan tried to dig the dough out with his hands. “If you want to get better quickly, don’t touch it. Lie still!” Zhu Menshang said.

Yang Yan recalled Doctor Sun saying Zhu Menshang was a fraud; could this be another one of his folk remedies? Ignoring Zhu Menshang’s command, he tried to dig it out again. Zhu Menshang stopped him, cursed a few more times, and pulled his hand back. Yang Yan tried again, and again Zhu Menshang stopped him. After this repeated a few times, Zhu Menshang swore, “Damn it, you’re not a monkey, you’re an ox!”

Their tempers flared. Zhu Menshang tore down a curtain and used it to tie Yang Yan’s hands and feet. As Yang Yan continued to struggle and twist, Zhu Menshang simply trussed him up like a dumpling. “You stupid ox, you won’t listen unless you’re tied up!” he cursed. Not one to back down, Yang Yan glared at Zhu Menshang, who glared right back. The two of them stared daggers at each other, neither willing to be the first to look away.

They were locked in this stubborn stalemate for about a quarter of an hour when a young woman entered the room and asked, “Young Master Zhu, that Doctor Sun is here again.”

Without turning his head, Zhu Menshang snapped, “Send that old fool back!”

“He brought people from the Beggar’s Sect,” the woman added. “He says you’ve kidnapped a youth.”

“Let Seventh Sister deal with them. Tell them not to bother me!” Zhu Menshang retorted.

The woman giggled. “Young Master Zhu, you’re in such a fiery mood. How about this servant helps you cool off?”

“Go help this stupid calf cool off!” Zhu Menshang said.

The woman said, “Young master on the bed, look at me. Am I not pretty?”

Hearing her address him, Yang Yan simply ignored her. The woman found their little battle amusing and walked closer to the bed, tickling Yang Yan’s nose with her hair. Seeing this, Zhu Menshang quickly shouted, “Don’t touch him!” In his haste, he inadvertently broke his gaze.

The woman jumped in fright. Zhu Menshang explained, “His mouth is sealed right now. If he sneezes, the breath will flow backward and could rupture his lungs.”

Not realizing the severity, the woman quickly apologized. Zhu Menshang sent her away and turned back to Yang Yan, only to see a triumphant glint in his eyes, clearly pleased at having won their staring contest. “That didn’t count! Let’s go again!” Zhu Menshang said angrily. Yang Yan turned his head away, refusing to look at him.

Frustrated, Zhu Menshang thought for a moment, then turned and fetched something. He walked back to Yang Yan and asked, “Do you know what this is?”

Yang Yan ignored him. Zhu Menshang held up a small box filled with tiny, wriggling worms. “These are maggots,” he said, then picked up a spatula and smeared the maggots on Yang Yan’s face. Yang Yan was furious but couldn't struggle. Zhu Menshang then covered his face with gauze and cursed, “I’m going to find a whore. You stubborn calf, if you’ve got the guts, don’t move. Let the maggots eat you. When flies start growing on your face, I’ll admit defeat and call you grandpa.”

After Zhu Menshang left, Yang Yan thought, ‘What is this fiend up to? What good does it do him to torture me like this?’ He couldn’t figure it out, and having exhausted a great deal of energy struggling earlier, he soon fell into a deep sleep.

When he next awoke, Zhu Menshang was drinking wine. Seeing him awake, he sneered, “Not dead yet, I see.” Yang Yan ignored him. Zhu Menshang came over with the wine pot to check on him. “What does your mouth taste like now? Sweet, sour, or bitter?”

‘This idiot,’ Yang Yan cursed inwardly. ‘You stuffed my mouth shut, how can I answer?’ But then he realized he could indeed taste a hint of sweetness on the tip of his tongue, the first flavor he had perceived in days.

Zhu Menshang then remembered that Yang Yan’s mouth was blocked. “I forgot your mouth is full of medicine. How about this: nod once for sweet, twice for sour, and three times for bitter. All right?”

Hearing him call the dough medicine, Yang Yan was puzzled. But he had woken up feeling much more refreshed and wanted to get out of this annoying predicament as soon as possible, so he nodded once.

Zhu Menshang nodded in acknowledgment but did not remove the dough from Yang Yan’s mouth. He brought over a basin of water and a small medicine box. First, he removed the gauze from Yang Yan’s face, washed the maggots from the wounds with water, and inspected them carefully for a moment before nodding in satisfaction. He picked up the spatula. “Don’t make a sound if you’ve got any courage,” he said, then scraped a small amount of ointment from the box and applied it to Yang Yan’s face. Yang Yan’s eyes flew open, the pain so intense he nearly fainted. But he was stubborn by nature; if he said he wouldn’t make a sound, he wouldn’t. His limbs, however, twitched uncontrollably.

After applying the medicine, Zhu Menshang covered the wounds with fresh gauze. “You’ll be able to get out of bed tomorrow. If you behave, I’ll untie you.”

Yang Yan turned his head away, ignoring him.

Zhu Menshang was about to leave when he heard a rumbling sound. He turned back and slapped his forehead. “Son of a bitch, I forgot to feed you! Not that you can eat much right now. Behave yourself, and I’ll have someone bring you some cold porridge.”

Zhu Menshang went out and returned a moment later with a pretty young woman in her early twenties. He pointed at Yang Yan and said, “He’s all yours.” With that, he dug the dough out of Yang Yan’s mouth. Yang Yan felt a sense of relief in his mouth and let out a long breath.

The young woman smiled. “I will attend to you, young master.” She picked up the bowl and began feeding Yang Yan spoonful by spoonful. He hadn’t eaten in a long time, and the cold porridge was mixed with minced meat, making it exceptionally fresh and delicious. He drank too quickly and started to cough. “Don’t rush, there’s plenty more, hehe…” the woman said.

Her voice was different from the previous woman’s, which made Yang Yan curious. He turned his head and asked, “Where is this place?” As the words left his mouth, he realized his speech was normal and his tongue moved with ease, much to his surprise.

The woman giggled. “This is the House of Hundred Fragrances.” Yang Yan was stunned. “A brothel?” The woman laughed. “If it wasn't a brothel, where would you find such a comfortable bed?” She then burst into another fit of giggles.

Yang Yan turned to Zhu Menshang and demanded angrily, “You brought me to a brothel?”

Zhu Menshang, who was kneading another batch of dough, replied, “What’s wrong with a brothel? The beds are comfortable, there are plenty of rooms, it’s a place of business so it’s kept very clean, and the sheets and blankets are all scalded with boiling water. Where else can you find so many attentive and considerate young women to take care of you? And once the patient is well, he can take a girl to another room to see if everything is in working order. Tell me, isn’t a brothel the best place to recover?”

The young woman chuckled. “To hear you talk, Young Master Zhu, one would think you plan to turn the House of Hundred Fragrances into a clinic.”

“Isn’t it a clinic right now?” Zhu Menshang laughed. “Otherwise, who would treat the venereal diseases you girls catch? And where did this dumb calf come from?”

The woman pointed at Yang Yan and giggled. “Look how you’ve tied him up. I didn’t realize you were into that sort of thing.”

Zhu Menshang grinned. “Want to try it yourself?”

“I’d love to,” she laughed. “I’m just waiting for Doctor Zhu to light the candles.” After feeding Yang Yan, she took the bowl to leave, and Zhu Menshang gave her bottom a playful slap on her way out.

Zhu Menshang brought the newly kneaded dough to Yang Yan. “Well? Your tongue feels much better, doesn’t it?” Yang Yan nodded. Zhu Menshang motioned for him to open his mouth. Yang Yan complied, and Zhu Menshang once again stuffed his mouth with the fresh dough. “Wounds on the tongue are the hardest to dress. Your wounds are deep, and they need to be held in place to heal properly. That old man Sun has first-rate character, second-rate medical skills, and a third-rate mind.”

Hearing him insult his benefactor, Yang Yan gave him a shove. “Still throwing a tantrum, you stubborn calf? If you don’t take your medicine properly, do I have to use force?”

Yang Yan knew he was a man of his word and guessed that he was, in fact, treating his injuries. He snorted but did not resist further.

Zhu Menshang continued, “Setting aside his lack of worldly sense, just look at how he handled your ulcerated wounds. He shouldn’t have washed off the maggots. You see, maggots eat only rotten flesh. Your wounds are small and numerous, making them difficult to clean. My guess is someone shoved ceramic shards into your mouth. You have to let the maggots clean it out first, and then the remaining wounds are much easier to treat. The formula I’m using is something Doctor Sun could never concoct. It first dissolves the damaged tissue, then grows new flesh. If you use this, you won’t be left with any scars.”

After filling Yang Yan’s mouth, Zhu Menshang went on, “I use this medicinal dough to treat the wounds on your tongue. On a person’s tongue, the tip tastes sweetness, the root bitterness, and the sides sourness. Since you can taste sweetness, it means your tongue is fifty percent healed. When you can taste sour, it’ll be about seventy percent healed, and if you can taste bitterness, then it’s a hundred percent recovered.”

Having said that, Zhu Menshang let out a soft “Hmm?” and looked at Yang Yan’s eyes. Seeing that the blood-red color around his pupils had not yet faded, he frowned. “You get some rest. I’ll come check on you again tomorrow.”

Another day passed. When Yang Yan woke up, the pain in his tongue and cheeks had mostly subsided, but his mouth was uncomfortably stuffed and his whole body was bound, rendering him immobile.

“If you behave, I’ll untie you,” said Zhu Menshang.

By now, Yang Yan had begun to trust Zhu Menshang’s abilities, knowing he wasn't a bad person, so he nodded. Zhu Menshang untied him, ordered a bath to be drawn, and let Yang Yan wash and change his clothes. After cleaning himself up, Yang Yan felt somewhat revived. He asked for a brush and paper and wrote, “Why did you want to harm Doctor Sun?” He handed the note to Zhu Menshang.

Zhu Menshang read the note and cursed, “Fuck! I told you that old man Sun has first-rate character, second-rate medical skills, and a third-rate mind. I’ve already insulted his medical skills, so now let’s talk about his mind. He’ll go to his grave without ever understanding what illness Madam Zhu had!”

Yang Yan looked at Zhu Menshang with a puzzled expression.

“What illness causes chest tightness, shortness of breath, and an inability to engage in marital relations?” Zhu Menshang said. “Madam Zhu looks perfectly fine on the outside, and old man Sun couldn’t find anything wrong. Chest tightness and shortness of breath—what specialty does that fall under? Inability to have relations—what about that one? And what does it mean if her pulse is normal? You don’t understand medicine, so I’ll tell you: none of it adds up. It’s all fake!”

Yang Yan looked surprised. Was Madam Zhu faking her illness? But why did she claim to be gradually recovering after Zhu Menshang’s diagnosis? Could it be that she and Zhu Menshang were colluding to cheat Master Zhu out of his money?

“Still don’t get it?” Zhu Menshang said. “Madam Zhu is indeed sick, but those aren’t the symptoms. She has a venereal disease.”

Yang Yan was even more confused. Knowing he couldn’t figure it out, Zhu Menshang continued, “Last month, I came to the House of Hundred Fragrances to offer free consultations and found that one of the girls was sick, so I treated her. I heard through the grapevine about Madam Zhu’s strange illness, and I also noticed that the Zhu family’s accountant was a frequent visitor here. The House of Hundred Fragrances is the biggest and best brothel in Fuzhou. How much could an accountant’s monthly salary be to afford coming here so often? He was either skimming from his master or someone was funding him. Putting two and two together, I figured out the whole story. Master Zhu is over sixty, fat and wide, while Madam Zhu is just twenty-four; they’re mismatched in looks and age. She was having an affair with the accountant and secretly giving him money, but she didn’t expect him to catch a venereal disease and pass it on to her. She was afraid of giving it to Master Zhu and having her affair exposed, so she made up excuses not to sleep with him. You tell me, could old man Sun cure that? They say even gods can’t save a person destined to die; in his case, a divine doctor can’t cure a patient who isn’t sick. He could have spent a hundred years on it and still wouldn’t have figured a damn thing out!”

Yang Yan was dumbfounded as he listened to this sordid tale.

Zhu Menshang continued, “I sought out the accountant and questioned him, and sure enough, I got the truth out of him. A rich mark like this falling into my lap—it would be a waste not to take advantage. So I went to the Zhu residence, spouted a bunch of nonsense to trick Master Zhu into not sleeping with his wife. As for the medicine I prescribed for Madam Zhu, it was all the correct remedy for her disease. By my estimation, she should be fully cured after a few more days of it.”

He spoke with a mixture of crude and refined language, peppered with the slang of a martial world swindler. Fortunately, having spent the last few days with him, Yang Yan had gotten used to it. He wrote again, “If your medical skills are so good, why do you need to swindle money?”

“I promised my master I would practice medicine for three years without charging a fee,” Zhu Menshang said. “I treat illnesses and save lives without taking a single coin. I provide free consultations for venereal diseases at the brothel, and the House of Hundred Fragrances provides all my food, drink, and female companionship. The accumulation of yang essence was a fake illness, and the medicine I gave Madam Zhu was for a fake prescription—it just so happened that the fake prescription was the right one for her real disease. That was a coincidence. Therefore, the money from Master Zhu was swindled, not earned from practicing medicine. I don’t charge for medicine, but I do charge for swindling.”

Yang Yan listened to his sophistry, which somehow seemed to make sense, and thought, ‘Doctor Sun may have been wrong about this man, but he wasn’t wrong when he said he spouts nonsense.’

“So, do you get it now?” Zhu Menshang asked.

Yang Yan nodded, then wrote, “Where is my sword?”

Zhu Menshang read the note and frowned. “Your sword is still at old man Sun’s place. I’ll send someone to get it back for you in a couple of days, after the wounds on your face have healed.”

Yang Yan shook his head and wrote, “I’m fine. I’m leaving today.”

Zhu Menshang slammed his hand on the table and yelled, “Leaving my ass! I’m the doctor here! You can leave when I say you can leave!”

Yang Yan hadn’t expected such a furious outburst and found it strange. Zhu Menshang said, “I don’t do things by halves. You’re not going anywhere until you’re truly healed. You owe me that!”

Ordinarily, Yang Yan’s defiant nature meant that the more someone pushed him, the harder he pushed back. But Zhu Menshang had saved his life, so he held his temper. However, his mind was consumed with thoughts of revenge. These past few days of delay meant his enemy was likely far away by now. The thought was agonizing, and he turned to leave at once.

“You won’t get your revenge like this,” Zhu Menshang said. “Your surname is Yang, right? News has come from Chongren County. I’ve heard all about what happened to your family.”

Yang Yan’s body trembled. He slowly turned around and stared at Zhu Menshang.

“I understand how you feel,” Zhu Menshang said calmly, “but you can’t get revenge this way.”

'No! You don’t understand!' Yang Yan looked at Zhu Menshang. 'You’re a good person, and a smart person, maybe even a worldly person, but you don’t know what it’s like to watch your family die in front of you! That kind of pain… it’s impossible to understand unless you’ve lived through it yourself!'
