# Chapter 10: A Cascade of Changes

Kunlun Year 85, autumn, eight month.

"The King's Iron Cavalry treads the crimson steps, his armored host bids ten thousand leagues farewell. A grand army bears the imperial decree, a dragon's chariot answers the mandate of heaven. This poem describes the magnificent air of the King of Wrath as he entered the capital."

The boy seated on the stool listened with great enthusiasm; though he had heard the story many times, a hot-blooded young man will always yearn for the glorious age of armored cavalry and clashing steel.

The old storyteller wore a benevolent expression, smiling as he spoke.

"But although the King of Wrath entered the capital, the realm was not yet at peace. Do you know why? Two matters troubled the King, and when the King is troubled, so too is the realm. Do you know what those two matters were?"

The boy replied, "I know! Beyond the border, there were still the hundred thousand barbarian soldiers of the Sa Cult, and at the border, there was Great General You Changbo, leading the seventy thousand strong Iron Cavalry of the Great Wall!"

"Indeed..." The old man took a long drag from his pipe, the embers at its tip glowing exceptionally bright. "When the King of Wrath entered the capital, he had the dragon throne dismantled and the homes of corrupt officials raided, distributing their treasures. The King's army was recruited from the heroic figures of the martial sects, honorable men who believed even thieves had a code, and everyone followed the rules, never troubling the common folk."

"Grandpa, you're lying! If they didn't trouble the people, why couldn't the King of Wrath stand to stay for even seven days, marching off to war at the border before he was even enthroned?"

A young girl's voice came from the side room; though the door was closed, the house was small, and her voice was still clear.

"Such nonsense to fool a child, it's nothing but a way to whitewash the Nine Great Families!"

"Who asked you to butt in!" the boy exclaimed, his face flushing with anger. "Grandpa is telling a story!"

"You've heard it a dozen times, and you're already fifteen! Grandpa, stop telling him these tall tales. Teach him a trade, don't let him just eat rice and do no work!"

"You're the one who just eats rice and does no work!"

"Alright now, do you want to listen to the story or argue with your sister?" The grandfather tapped his pipe twice on the leg of the stool, making a _thump, thump_ sound, signaling the boy to stop being distracted.

Though still indignant, the boy suppressed his anger. "Please continue, Grandpa."

"Although that wicked previous dynasty was destroyed, two major threats remained. For the sake of the common people, less than seven days after entering the capital, the King of Wrath left General Ma Wentao to guard the city while he himself led the great heroes of the martial sects in a mighty procession towards the Great Wall. At that time, both the Barbarian King and You Changbo had their own schemes. The Barbarian King hoped the King of Wrath and the Iron Cavalry of the Great Wall would destroy each other, while You Changbo wanted to use the King of Wrath to fight the barbarian soldiers and then reap the benefits."

"The King of Wrath is an upright and honorable hero who disdains such petty tricks!" the boy continued. "When the heroes reached the Great Wall, they first attacked You Changbo."

"That's right, the King of Wrath was no coward; of course, he would fight an honorable battle. The heroes clashed fiercely with the Iron Cavalry of the Great Wall, the slaughter leaving corpses strewn across the fields. The Barbarian King, thinking his opportunity had arrived, led his soldiers to breach the Great Wall and charge into the fray. By then, the heroes and the Iron Cavalry had been fighting for a day and a night and were exhausted; the Barbarian King thought he could snatch an easy victory. Unexpectedly, You Changbo roared, 'Better to die a subject than live a slave, better to yield a dynasty than lose a nation!' He then led the Iron Cavalry of the Great Wall to join forces with the King of Wrath and fight the Barbarian King. But the barbarian forces were powerful; You Changbo charged three times and was struck by five arrows, yet was still repelled. The barbarian soldiers surrounded the heroes, and it seemed this great land was about to fall into the hands of the barbarians..."

At this point, the grandfather took a puff from his pipe and said no more. The boy knew that his grandfather would always pause at the most critical moments to keep him in suspense, waiting for him to ask, "And then? What happened next?"

The grandfather chuckled and continued, "The King of Wrath's great general, Ma Wentao, charged in with heroes from Mount Hua, the Beggar's Sect, and the Mount Heng Sect. These men had been in the south, fighting the defeated armies of the previous dynasty. When the King of Wrath entered the capital and news of the emperor's death spread, the defeated armies lost their object of loyalty and surrendered one after another. With the threat in the south resolved, they went to the capital to assist the King of Wrath. With this fresh force, General Ma entrusted the capital to the care of Abbess Dingwen, the leader of the Mount Heng Sect at the time, and led his men to reinforce the King of Wrath."

"With the arrival of reinforcements came another great slaughter, one that lasted for three full days and nights. The King of Wrath charged ahead of his men into the enemy's central army. Though he slew the Barbarian King, he too was surrounded. Arrows rained down and stones flew like locusts. Li Shuliang, the leader of Mount Hua, fearlessly charged into the encirclement to rescue him, but in the end, returned only with the King of Wrath's body. Alas..."

Whenever the story reached this part, the old man would, as always, let out a long sigh to express his sorrow for the fallen hero.

"After that, the barbarians retreated beyond the Great Wall, and You Changbo died from his grievous wounds. What followed was thirty years of chaotic warfare. It wasn't until the Kunlun council of the Nine Great Families, over ninety years ago, that the world became what it is today. Nowadays, even chivalrous heroes must follow rules."

Yang Yan added, "I know. You have to find a master, join a sect, and receive a Writ of Chivalry. Once you have a Writ of Chivalry, you can avenge wrongs and uphold justice as you please."

"Pah," his grandfather said. "It just means you can piss wherever you want."

Yang Yan let out a "hee" and laughed.

His grandfather continued, "In short, the Kunlun council established the rules of the martial world. The Nine Great Families must abide by them, and the hundreds of sects and clans under them must also abide by them."

Having said that, the old man noticed his tobacco was gone. He tapped out his pipe and took a fresh pouch from his robes.

"The story's over, time for your practice," the old man said as he stuffed his pipe.

"I'm going to see what good food Mom is cooking tonight!" The boy quickly got up and ran towards the kitchen.

The kitchen was not large; aside from a stove and a long table, there was only enough space for one person to turn around. Mrs. Yang stood before the stove, a thin sheen of sweat on her forehead. The pot on the stove was billowing thick white steam. She lifted the lid, and a rich, fragrant aroma immediately filled the air.

She ladled a small spoonful of soup, brought it to her lips, and took a careful sip, the corners of her mouth turning up in a slight smile, whether in satisfaction with her own cooking or in anticipation of her family's enjoyment of the soup.

"Mom~" the boy burst into the kitchen.

Mrs. Yang's brows furrowed in feigned helplessness, but the doting look in her eyes was plain to see.

"Yan'er, how many times have I told you not to come into the kitchen? Haven't you heard what Teacher Meng said..." Mrs. Yang stood with one hand on her hip and the other holding the ladle, her almond-shaped eyes wide as she stared at Yang Yan, who was about to step into the kitchen.

"I know, 'a gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen'!" Yang Yan's black hair hung down his back, simply tied up halfway with a ribbon. He had inherited his mother's looks and was quite handsome, yet without any trace of effeminacy; his bright, clever eyes shone with intelligence. Everyone who met him said his eyes were like stars, exceptionally beautiful.

Mrs. Yang wore a helpless expression, grabbing a handful of scallions and placing them on the cutting board.

"Since you know, then hurry up and leave. Let your grandfather teach you a move or two, or go read a few pages of a book." She chopped the scallions deftly, each piece cut with perfect uniformity.

Yang Yan leaned against the wall, pouting. "Grandpa doesn't have two moves. All he ever teaches is that 'Withered Branch' move."

"And Grandpa only has a few stories. How is it that you never tire of hearing them?"

"Grandpa loves to tell them, and someone has to listen, or else he'd be lonely," Yang Yan said with a grin. "In a few years, my little brother can take over listening for me."

Mrs. Yang placed the chopped scallions into a bowl. "Then you should also practice that 'Withered Branch' move a few more times to make your grandfather happy. In any case, stay out of the kitchen."

"Mom~ I can't even be bothered to follow the rules of the living, why should I follow the rules of the dead?" Yang Yan suddenly straightened up and walked into the kitchen. "You tell me not to come in, but I insist on coming in, and I'm going to help you chop vegetables and cook."

He walked over to his mother's side and reached for the kitchen knife in her hand.

With a deft flick of her wrist, Mrs. Yang spun out of Yang Yan's reach in the blink of an eye.

Half annoyed and half amused, she said, "I give up, I won't try to make you leave. Just stand back and don't get in my way."

Yang Yan flashed a triumphant smile and retreated to the doorway. Mrs. Yang picked up the celery on the table and began to mince it. Watching his mother cook, Yang Yan suddenly remembered something and asked, "Mom~ I've seen other families invite all the neighbors to celebrate when their children are one month and one year old. Why didn't our family invite anyone for my little brother's first birthday a few days ago?"

Mrs. Yang paused, and some of the celery spilled from the bowl.

"Your grandfather doesn't like crowds," she said. "You just said you don't like to follow rules, and now you're fussing about etiquette. Aren't you contradicting yourself?"

Yang Yan wanted to ask more, but his mother's words stopped him. He grumbled, "I just thought it was strange."

Mrs. Yang lifted the pot lid again and tasted the soup. "This radish and pork rib stew is your favorite. Go get your father to come home for dinner; it won't be as good if it gets cold."

Just the smell alone was making Yang Yan's mouth water.

"Okay, I'll go right now!" he shouted.

"Change your clothes before you go! You're all sweaty; be careful not to catch a cold in the wind!" Mrs. Yang called after Yang Yan's retreating back.

'It's time to have a serious talk with the children's father about those things,' Mrs. Yang thought, watching the steam rise endlessly from the soup pot.

Yang Yan returned to his room and opened the wardrobe.

"One, two, three..." He counted his robes with his finger. He did not have many, only five in total, but he could only count three.

One was on his back, but where had the other one gone?

The one that was missing happened to be his favorite, custom-made by a tailor for his fifteenth birthday at his mother's request. It was a long robe of cyan satin, smooth to the touch and embroidered with elegant bamboo branches; he couldn't bear to wear it on any but the most important occasions. He remembered wearing it for his younger brother's first birthday a few days ago, and he had seen it just the day before yesterday.

Suddenly, Yang Yan realized something and stormed out of his room in a fury.

'That thief!' he thought. 'She must have stolen it!'

Yang Yan hurried to his sister's room, and the sound of a sweet song drifted to his ears: "For my cruel love, I keep a ledger of longing. Old longing, new longing, recorded busily from morn till night. Line by line, word by word, the accounts are all clear. The old longing is not yet repaid, and a great new longing is added to the bill."

The singing voice was not unpleasant, but it held no trace of sorrow or melancholy, and even carried a hint of joy, making its meaning unclear.

Yang Yan stopped at the door and cursed inwardly, 'Sounds like a crowing rooster, it hurts my ears!'

He raised his hand and knocked, the sound urgent and filled with anger.

The person in the room paid him no mind, continuing to sing her little tune: "Let me take out this ledger of longing and settle the accounts with you. How much I have repaid you, I know not, nor how much longing I still owe." It seemed the song of longing was growing ever more cheerful.

Yang Yan finally had enough and kicked the door open.

An eighteen-year-old girl sat at a table, holding an embroidery needle, peacefully working on her embroidery, not the least bit startled.

"Brother, why are you so rough? You truly frightened me. Frightening me is one thing, but it wouldn't do to frighten our little brother."

Beside Yang Shanshan was a cradle where an infant slept soundly, looking like a pink jade carving, a smile on his lips as if he were having a pleasant dream.

Yang Yan lowered his voice, but his anger did not diminish. "Where are my clothes?"

Yang Shanshan put down her needle and thread, a smile playing on her lips as she looked at Yang Yan.

"I saw you rarely wear that robe, so I cut it up to make new clothes for our little brother. Come and see, doesn't it suit him well?"

"You!..." Yang Yan was so angry he was speechless. He walked over and saw that the baby in the cradle was indeed wearing his cyan satin robe.

"Brother, you haven't answered me. Does it suit our little brother or not?" Yang Shanshan smiled radiantly, like a profusion of spring blossoms.

Yang Yan glared resentfully at Yang Shanshan. He couldn't count how many times this thief had bullied him, and he had no idea how he had offended her. This time, unable to think of a new trick, she had set her sights on his favorite robe. It was truly despicable!

"Why aren't you saying anything? Are you reluctant to let your own robe be made into clothes for our little brother?"

'I really want to punch that smiling face!' Yang Yan suppressed his anger.

"Of course I'm willing! Where's the rest of the fabric?"

Yang Shanshan hadn't expected him to ask that. She intended to dismiss him casually, but on second thought, letting him see the ruined robe might just make him fume with rage.

"Wait a moment, I'll get it for you," she said, rising and gracefully walking towards a cabinet.

Yang Yan's eyes were quick; while Yang Shanshan wasn't looking, he snatched something from the table and hid it in his sleeve. Yang Shanshan soon returned with a robe that had been cut into a mess of holes and handed it to him.

"Here, take it. This is all that's left."

Yang Yan angrily snatched the robe, shook it out to look, and seeing there wasn't much material left, asked, "Why is there only this much?"

"I messed it up and threw the rest away," Yang Shanshan said, rolling her eyes as if the question were redundant.

Yang Yan didn't want to say any more to her and quickly left the room, not wanting to stay a moment longer. Seeing Yang Yan's suppressed anger, Yang Shanshan felt quite pleased with herself.

Yang Yan returned to his room, slammed the door, and walked to his desk. He pulled open a drawer and skillfully fumbled around the top of it, retrieving a small wooden box from a hidden compartment. This compartment had been specially carved by his father when he made the desk, its seams perfectly aligned with the natural grain of the wood, making it completely invisible to the unknowing eye.

His father had told him that everyone has a few secrets they don't want others to see, and that's when a hidden compartment comes in handy. He also promised he would never peek at what Yang Yan hid, treating it as a secret between father and son, so Yang Yan could rest assured.

At the time, Yang Yan hadn't thought much of it. He just figured that, by that logic, his father must have his own hidden compartment, so he curiously asked what treasure his father had hidden.

His father whispered in his ear, "Don't tell your mother, but Dad just hides a bit of money for wine."

Yang Yan couldn't help but chuckle. "Mom treats you so well. If you like it, how could she not buy it for you? Why would you need to hide money?"

His father shook his head and told Yang Yan he would understand when he grew up and got married. Yang Yan shrugged and didn't press the matter.

Yang Yan took the small box from the secret compartment and from it, removed a lumpy iron ball, just big enough to fit in his palm. He then took an embroidery needle from his sleeve, bent it with his thumb, and kneaded it into the iron ball. Upon closer inspection, the iron ball was actually formed from a great number of embroidery needles, densely intertwined, too many to count.

'Dad surely never imagined I'd use this secret compartment to hide my anger towards my sister.'

Every time Yang Shanshan bullied him, although Yang Yan was furious, he mostly endured it due to their relationship and his family's persuasion. However, he would always find a way to steal Yang Shanshan's embroidery needles to vent his frustration.

Yang Yan tossed the iron ball in his hand, imagining Yang Shanshan crawling on her floor searching for her embroidery needles, and the resentment in his heart eased somewhat. He remembered the task his mother had given him, put the iron ball back in its secret compartment, and left without changing his clothes—after the whole ordeal with Yang Shanshan, his sweat had long since dried.

Yang Yan's father, Yang Zhengde, was a carpenter of exquisite skill and fair prices. Whenever someone in town needed a house built, they would likely invite him to do the woodwork. Sometimes, when he saw that a poor family's house was dilapidated or their furniture was damaged, he would offer to help with repairs and refuse payment afterward. The townspeople all considered him a good man, just with a peculiar temperament. He lived outside the town, kept an extremely low profile, rarely socialized, never visited others' homes, and never invited people to his.

Yang Yan walked quickly to the place where his father was working. It was a residence under construction in the eastern part of town, covering sixty mu of land and named Liuya Villa. It was a grand estate with four courtyards, clearly the home of a wealthy family.

A group of craftsmen were gathered by a wall, shouting and making a racket. Yang Yan knew his father wouldn't be among them, but he had to ask them to find out where his father was. He called out a few times, but his voice was drowned out by the noise, so he had to shout at the top of his lungs, "Has anyone seen my father?"

A craftsman with a cloth tied around his head yelled back without turning, "Your dad is still inside the courtyard carving the beams. You'll have to wait a bit!"

Yang Yan looked towards the villa. He had never been inside nor seen such a magnificent house and couldn't help but feel curious. He walked around the corner of the wall and saw that the main gate was ajar, so he gently pushed it open a crack and peeked inside. All he saw was a patch of barren land, a few trees, and some oddly shaped rocks piled in a corner; the garden had not yet been laid out. Just as Yang Yan was about to go in to find his father, a slender figure suddenly appeared before him.

"Little brother, you can't go in." Yang Yan recognized the voice and felt a fire rise in his belly.

It was a fair-skinned and handsome young man with a sword at his waist. His name was Qin Jiuxian, a guard hired by the estate who also served as a semi-foreman. Six months ago, Yang Yan had sprained his ankle while practicing with his sword, and Yang Shanshan had reluctantly delivered lunch for their father. She and Qin Jiuxian had hit it off immediately. Qin Jiuxian often found excuses to visit the Yang family, a fact not lost on anyone. Yang Yan disliked his sister, and naturally had no fondness for Qin Jiuxian either.

"Who's your little brother? I'm looking for my dad," Yang Yan said. "Don't block my way."

As Yang Yan tried to push past, Qin Jiuxian blocked him again.

"The master has given orders that only workers are allowed inside. Don't be a nuisance, kid."

'He's just a guard, what's he so proud of?' Yang Yan thought, his gaze falling on Qin Jiuxian's belt. It was cyan satin, silky and smooth to the eye—wasn't that the fabric from his robe? Yang Yan was instantly enraged and demanded, "Where did you get that belt?"

"Your sister gave it to me. Nice, isn't it?" Qin Jiuxian spun around to show it off, but unexpectedly lost his balance as Yang Yan gave him a hard shove.

"What are you doing?" Qin Jiuxian was bewildered.

Yang Yan lunged at him, grabbing his belt and yelling, "This is mine, give it back!"

Qin Jiuxian flew into a rage, cursing, "Are you looking to die?"

"That thief! Give me back my clothes, give them back! You thief, you stole my things!" Yang Yan shouted, refusing to let go.

Qin Jiuxian slapped Yang Yan across the face, but Yang Yan held fast to the belt, nearly tearing it off. Qin Jiuxian grabbed Yang Yan's wrists with both hands and twisted them outwards, the pain bringing tears to Yang Yan's eyes.

"You ungrateful brat!" Qin Jiuxian cursed, kicking Yang Yan to the ground.

Yang Yan got back to his feet and, with a move like a withered branch, used his fingers as a sword to jab at Qin Jiuxian's waist. But his form was clumsy, and Qin Jiuxian simply kicked him down again.

Yang Yan had fallen twice and ached all over, but he was stubborn and got up again.

Qin Jiuxian cursed, "If you keep this up, don't blame me for hurting you!"

"Bring it on!" Yang Yan charged again.

"Yan'er." A familiar voice called out. Yang Yan looked up to see his father, Yang Zhengde, holding his carpentry tools and frowning at the two of them.

Seeing an elder arrive, Qin Jiuxian held back. Yang Yan seized the opportunity to rush forward, but Qin Jiuxian dodged aside. Yang Yan used too much force and tripped on a step, about to fall again, but Yang Zhengde was quick and caught him in one motion.

"What's going on? Why such a temper?" Yang Zhengde asked. Qin Jiuxian spread his hands, indicating he didn't know. Yang Zhengde looked at Yang Yan, who was still fuming, just glaring at Qin Jiuxian and panting heavily.

"Stop being angry. Let's go home," Yang Zhengde said, taking Yang Yan's hand. Yang Yan dared not struggle.

"Young Master Qin, would you care to join us for a simple meal?" Yang Zhengde asked.

Seeing the situation, Qin Jiuxian dared not accept and quickly said, "No, thank you, Uncle Yang. I didn't realize your family knew martial arts."

He was trying to find a topic to ease the awkwardness, seeing that Yang Yan was still glaring at him.

"In this day and age, you could find a dog on the street that knows a move or two. They look fancy, but they're all empty postures, useless as hell," Yang Zhengde said.

Qin Jiuxian nodded repeatedly, though he felt something was off; the words seemed to be a roundabout criticism of him. But Yang Zhengde was an honest and sincere man, and he was courting his daughter, so it must have been unintentional. He quickly nodded and said, "Yes, of course. Take care, Uncle Yang."

Yang Zhengde led Yang Yan home, and Yang Yan sulked the entire way.

Yang Zhengde suddenly said, "Don't be angry anymore. When I finish this job and get paid, Dad will buy you a new robe."

Yang Yan's eyes widened as he looked at his father.

"The moment I started work, I saw his belt and understood everything. Ai, I don't know what kind of feud you and Shan'er had in a past life, you can't even get along for a moment," Yang Zhengde said.

"That thief!" Yang Yan said hatefully.

"That's your sister," Yang Zhengde said, his face stern as he lectured him. "In a few years, she'll be married. When that time comes, you might even miss her."

Yang Yan snorted, clearly unconvinced.

At dinner, Mrs. Yang saw Yang Yan's bruised face and asked a few questions. Yang Yan only replied that he had been bitten by a rabid dog, shooting a glare at Yang Shanshan. Yang Zhengde ladled a bowl of soup for Yang Yan. Yang Shanshan clamored for a bowl too. Yang Zhengde just sighed, while their grandfather laughed happily.

That night, Yang Yan tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Thinking about the afternoon's events, he grew more and more resentful. His 'Withered Branch' move had been just inches away; it was all his fault for not practicing regularly. Unable to sleep anyway, he decided to get up. The room was too small to practice, so he tiptoed out into the courtyard, picked up a dry branch, and began practicing the 'Withered Branch' move.

He practiced it over and over, thinking that if he could master this move, his grandfather would teach him the second. He didn't have much faith in his grandfather's skills, but in his eyes, Qin Jiuxian was just as his father had described: "looks fancy, but all empty postures." He figured he only needed to learn two or three moves to beat him to a pulp.

He practiced like this for the better part of an hour when he suddenly heard a "thump," as if something had hit a window. He looked towards the sound, which came from the direction of Yang Shanshan's room. A moment later, he heard another faint noise. Suspicious, he walked out of the courtyard and circled around to the west side.

The moonlight was bright, making it easy to see. He saw that the window to Yang Shanshan's room was unlatched, and in the moonlight, two figures, one after the other, walked towards the woods. He recognized them: it was that damnable Yang Shanshan and Qin Jiuxian.

'What are those two up to in the middle of the night?' A thought struck him. He waited for them to enter the woods before stealthily following.

Just as he stepped into the woods, he heard the two of them whispering intimately. Yang Yan couldn't hear clearly, so he crouched down and crawled slowly forward on all fours.

He heard Yang Shanshan ask in a low voice, "When are you going to propose marriage to me?"

"Once the mansion is completed, I will go to your father to propose. Right now, he is a craftsman and I am a guard; I'm afraid people will gossip."

"Mmm..." He heard Yang Shanshan let out a soft moan. The moonlight was blocked by the trees, making it difficult to see. Yang Yan was still far away and could only vaguely make out two figures embracing and rubbing against each other.

He heard faint sounds, "What gossip is there to talk about? You're just making excuses."

"Heaven is my witness... mmm..."

"...Really?"

The sounds of panting and moaning grew louder. Yang Yan felt his face flush and his mind grow hot, not understanding what was happening to him.

It wasn't until he heard Qin Jiuxian say, "I have a Writ of Chivalry. If I were to defile an innocent maiden, I would be condemned by the whole world... How could I dare..." that he realized something was wrong.

He scrambled to leave, but in his haste, he made a noise. Not caring if he had been discovered, Yang Yan fled.

Qin Jiuxian was startled. Yang Shanshan quickly straightened her clothes. She saw a figure darting through the woods and exclaimed in alarm, "Could that be Father?"

Qin Jiuxian, also fearing it was Mr. Yang, did not dare to give chase and left the woods with Yang Shanshan.

In the moonlight, they could see the figure of a young boy running away in the distance.

※※※

The next morning, Yang Yan was lethargic and didn't dare to meet Yang Shanshan's eyes at breakfast. When his mother asked, he just said his wounds had hurt during the night and he hadn't slept well. After breakfast, he made the excuse of needing to catch up on sleep.

He had just returned to his room, his mind racing with wild thoughts, when Yang Shanshan knocked and entered. Yang Yan was startled to see his sister. Yang Shanshan, however, acted unusually gentle and said, "Little brother, let's make a deal."

Yang Yan knew what she was up to. He finally had something on her, and he immediately retorted, "Aren't you afraid Dad will break your legs for your secret midnight rendezvous?"

Yang Shanshan snorted. "He's about to propose, what's there to be afraid of?"

"Then I'll go tell Dad!" As soon as Yang Yan stood up, Yang Shanshan blocked his way. "Don't cause trouble."

'I'm going to cause trouble!' Yang Yan thought. He had finally caught his chance, but he hadn't yet figured out how to get his revenge. He just said, "Who told you to ruin my clothes!"

"It's just an old robe, I'll compensate you, alright?" Yang Shanshan said. "Young Master Qin will be here later. I'll take you out, and whatever clothes or accessories you want to buy, I'll have him buy them all for you. How about that?"

Yang Yan was about to argue back, but then he had an idea. Why not take this opportunity for revenge? He nodded.

"You better not go back on your word!"

"Look how eager you are," Yang Shanshan said. "I said it, so I won't go back on it."

After noon, Qin Jiuxian indeed arrived. Yang Yan saw him peeking around outside, knowing he felt guilty. It wasn't until Yang Shanshan gave him a look that he entered. Qin Jiuxian greeted them and said he wanted to take Yang Shanshan into town. Yang Shanshan said she would bring Yang Yan along to broaden his horizons.

This shocked the elders of the Yang family.

"Is it going to rain blood from the heavens?" their grandfather said, looking at the sky with great concern.

"If you take your brother and sell him, even as my daughter, I won't forgive you," Yang Zhengde said sternly.

"How much is this rough country boy worth?" Yang Shanshan retorted. "I'd have to pay someone to take him."

Yang Zhengde replied, "My son is clever and bright. You may not appreciate him, but others would be fighting to dote on him."

"You two, stop your bickering," Mrs. Yang interjected. "Go on, but be back early."

The three of them went into town. Along the way, Yang Shanshan was busy flirting with Qin Jiuxian, while Yang Yan followed silently behind, his mind filled with plots on how to swindle this adulterous pair.

Yang Shanshan had informed Qin Jiuxian of the plan. The three of them arrived at a small clothier's shop, and Yang Yan immediately shouted, "Bring out your best fabrics!"

The shop owner brought out several bolts of satin. Yang Yan picked through them but was not satisfied. He pointed at Qin Jiuxian's belt and asked, "Do you have this kind of fabric?"

The shop owner glanced at it and said, "That's high-grade silk. I don't have it in stock. You'll have to go to Baoqing House, two streets over. They have a wide and fine selection, but the prices aren't cheap."

At the mention of Baoqing House, Qin Jiuxian's brow furrowed, which Yang Yan noticed.

"Thank you, sir. We'll come back another day," Yang Yan said, and turned to leave.

Yang Shanshan caught up with him. "Why didn't you choose one?"

"You think you can fob me off with that trash?" Yang Yan said. "We're going to Baoqing House."

The three of them arrived at Baoqing House, the largest silk and satin shop in the city. All sorts of fabrics were displayed in a dazzling array, along with various accessories like hairpins, headpieces, waist pendants, and jade belt hooks.

It was Yang Yan's first time in such a large shop, and it was a real eye-opener. He couldn't help but touch this and that. The shopkeeper, seeing his shabby clothes, hurried over.

"Young master, please don't touch everything. If you break something, you'll have to pay for it."

Yang Yan didn't even look at him. "Shopkeeper, you fail to recognize a great man. The great hero Qin is here, can't you see?"

Qin Jiuxian was quite embarrassed and could only offer the shopkeeper a faint smile.

Yang Yan continued, "Shopkeeper, bring out your finest fabrics."

The shopkeeper looked at him skeptically for a moment, then went to the back and brought out two bolts of cloth. Judging by the texture and color alone, it was clear they were of superior quality.

"This is Shu brocade, top grade, three hundred coins per foot."

Upon hearing the price, Qin Jiuxian's face immediately changed.

"We don't need such fine fabric, do we?" Seeing his expression, Yang Yan gloated inwardly.

Yang Shanshan said, "Don't take advantage of the situation. You broke it, so we'll replace it."

"You're the one who said you'd buy me whatever I want, and I like this fabric," Yang Yan said.

Yang Shanshan didn't waste words with him. She pointed at Qin Jiuxian's belt and asked, "Do you have this kind of material?"

The shopkeeper looked and said, "We just ran out of that satin. We won't get more until next month."

"I can't wait that long," Yang Yan said, his anger flaring. "If you don't have this material, you have to compensate me for it. Otherwise, we're going home!"

He then asked the shopkeeper, "Do you have anything better? Bring it out for us to see."

The shopkeeper replied, "We have Su brocade with Su embroidery, five hundred coins per foot. I keep it in the back room."

"Bring it out and let us have a look," Yang Yan said.

Qin Jiuxian said, "Little brother, don't go too far!"

Yang Yan shot him a dirty look and ignored him. Qin Jiuxian continued, "We'll be family soon enough. I'm treating you as my future brother-in-law, and you're taking advantage of me. For a worthless belt, you're trying to swindle me out of several taels of silver?"

Yang Yan retorted, "That was a robe my mother gave me, and you can't afford to replace it!"

Qin Jiuxian made a move as if to strike him, but Yang Yan stood his ground, not flinching in the slightest. With Yang Shanshan there, Qin Jiuxian had no choice but to swallow his anger.

Seeing the situation getting out of hand, Yang Shanshan pulled Yang Yan outside and scolded him, "Don't be so ungrateful!"

Yang Yan retorted, "I am ungrateful! Give me back my clothes!"

He then tried to snatch the belt from Qin Jiuxian's waist again.

Enraged, Yang Shanshan slapped him across the face. Yang Yan staggered back a few steps, his eyes turning red.

"You thief, you dare to hit me!" he cursed. Yang Shanshan cursed back, "So what if I hit you? Get lost!"

Yang Yan turned and walked away. Qin Jiuxian started to follow, but Yang Shanshan grabbed him and snapped, "What are you chasing him for?"

"What if he tells everyone about us..." Qin Jiuxian said, still looking in the direction Yang Yan had gone.

"He's my brother, I know him! He won't tell," Yang Shanshan snapped. "Buying a few feet of cloth is like cutting flesh from your bones! You go back and prepare. Come to my house tonight to propose. If you make any more excuses, I'll drag you to the Chongren branch!"

With that, she also stormed off in a huff.

Watching his customers run off, the owner of Baoqing House poked his head out and asked, "Sir, are you proposing? I have some fine cloth for a wedding dress, would you like to take a look?"

Qin Jiuxian shot him a glare.

After leaving Baoqing House, Yang Yan was fuming. He turned a corner, sat on the ground, and sulked, endlessly cursing that pair, Yang Shanshan and her lover.

He did not actually want to tell his parents about what happened last night; it had just been a moment of bravado. He knew the rules: raping a woman was a crime condemned by all under heaven. If it were reported to the local sect, the perpetrator would be immediately apprehended. If he fled, a warrant would be issued, and it wouldn't matter which of the Nine Great Families' territories he hid in—someone would drag him out.

Qin Jiuxian was destined to be his brother-in-law. Telling his parents would only make them unhappy, and they would, at most, scold Yang Shanshan a little, which hardly counted as revenge. But if Yang Shanshan were to marry, wouldn't his years of enmity be for naught? No, he had to make her suffer.

He mulled it over but could not think of a good plan. Yang Shanshan had a fierce personality. He had tried scaring her with frogs and little snakes before, but she had simply stomped them to death. He, on the other hand, had been the one unable to bear it, feeling miserable for days. He also considered ruining her makeup box or breaking some of her trinkets, but then he thought of how hard his parents worked for their money, and how anything he broke would have to be replaced.

'Is there really nothing I can do to that wretched girl?' Yang Yan wondered in a daze. Suddenly, he heard a commotion; it turned out someone nearby was holding a play in offering to the gods. Feeling aimless, Yang Yan rose and followed the crowd to join in the fun.

When he arrived before the stage, he remembered his parents taking him to see plays when he was little. Back then, he could not understand the lyrics and only thought the painted female roles on stage were colorful and beautiful. Now, looking again, he naturally understood things a little more clearly than he had as a child.

The opera being performed was a re-edited scene, _Lin Chong Flees at Night._ He had never read _Water Margin_, so this was his first time hearing the story. He could roughly grasp that it was about a hero named Lin Chong who was framed and ruined by Grand Marshal Gao Qiu. The scene began with the burning of the fodder depot and continued until Lin Chong learned of his wife's death and resolved to go to Mount Liang.

The lyrics rang out:

"I hoped to be a marquis like Ban Chao a thousand leagues from home,
But now I'm a red-scarfed rebel, a Yellow Turban who betrayed his lord.
Like a falcon freed of its jesses, a cunning rabbit loosed from its cage, a dragon bursting from a net.
Who will execute the treacherous to save our nation from peril?
Where is the Gao Tao to uphold the law?
With this graying hair and these meager belongings,
I have won a chance to turn the heavens and the earth, to make the seas boil and the mountains shake."

The actor’s singing and performance were superb, filled with a rousing passion that stirred a sense of injustice in Yang Yan’s heart. He saw himself as Lin Chong and his sister as Gao Qiu, feeling that Lin Chong was just as wronged as he was.

Then he heard:

"My mother and wife, on whom can they rely?
My own fate here is unknown,
And their lives there hang by a thread.
Fear grips me, sweat pours like scalding water,
Anxiety sears me, my heart burns like fire!
My young wife, where is she now?
My old parents, lost in vain,
The grace of their toil I can never repay.
I cry out—how can a hero's spirit be quelled, a hero's spirit be quelled?"

He felt Lin Chong's anguish and was deeply moved.

And so, Yang Yan listened all the way until Lin Chong went to Mount Liang. The audience rose, applauding and cheering, and he clapped and cheered along with them. Just as he wanted to hear what came next, he noticed the crowd beginning to disperse.

He asked in surprise, "That's it? It's over? Isn't he going to kill Gao Qiu?"

Someone replied, "It's over. If you want to know what happens next, go read _Water Margin_."

'_Water Tiger_?' Yang Yan silently committed the name to memory, puzzled. 

'Lin Chong is a fierce tiger. He's going up a mountain, so it should be the Tale of the Mountain Tiger. Why is it a water tiger? How can there be tigers by the water?'[^5]

Regardless, he would find this book to read one day. To see Lin Chong kill Gao Qiu—that would be truly satisfying.

Though their situations were similar, he could not possibly kill his sister. Yang Yan had watched an opera scene, but he was still no closer to a plan for revenge and could only wander the streets aimlessly. He happened to stop before a blacksmith's shop. Yang Yan peered inside and saw swords and sabers on display, along with household items like kitchen knives and firewood choppers. He paused as an idea suddenly struck him, and he asked the blacksmith, "Do you have any small scissors?"

"Yes, we have all kinds. What do you need to cut, young man? Hair? Fabric?"

"Fabric," Yang Yan replied. "A smaller pair, not too big."

The blacksmith handed him a pair of tailor's shears. Yang Yan looked at them and said, "Still too big. Do you have anything smaller?"

The blacksmith replied, "This is the smallest pair we have."

Yang Yan pouted and asked again, "Then are there no smaller scissors?" 

The blacksmith thought for a moment, then produced a pair of nail scissors half the size of a palm.

"These are for cutting nails. See if they'll work for you."

Yang Yan weighed them in his hand and asked, "Can these cut through fabric?"

"Coarse hemp would be a bit difficult, and they're not very sharp for cutting brocade."

"How much?" Yang Yan thought to himself that he would have to make do.

The blacksmith said, "Fifteen wen."

Yang Yan felt his pocket and found only five wen. His face fell, and he handed the nail scissors back to the blacksmith. "Never mind."

"You're from Yang Zhengde's family, aren't you, young man? When Master Tao was building his house, I worked as an ironworker there. I saw you bring meals to old brother Yang." Yang Yan was surprised the man recognized him and nodded.

The blacksmith handed the scissors back to Yang Yan. "My cousin-in-law is a widow raising a child, and when her roof was leaking, it was old brother Yang who helped patch it up. I've always remembered his kindness. Take these nail scissors as a gift."

Yang Yan said happily, "Really?"

"Old brother Yang has helped many people; everyone is grateful to him." 

With that, he took the nail scissors back from Yang Yan's hand. "Let me sharpen them for you a bit."

Yang Yan accepted the gift, thinking his revenge was now within reach. Seeing that it was nearly dusk, he knew it was time to head home. He left the town and entered the woods. His house was just beyond the forest, a solitary dwelling that the occasional visitor always said was easy to find.

Yang Yan walked through the trees as the orange glow of the sky began to dim. As he walked, he wondered what else there might be for dinner besides radish and braised pork ribs.

As he thought, he caught the scent of radishes. Delighted, Yang Yan broke into a run, sprinting all the way to his front door.

The moment he pushed the door open, he heard the clang of swords.

Silver light and blood—that was the first thing Yang Yan saw. Blood stained the swords, his grandfather, his father, his mother, and the men in green and blue robes.

Before Yang Yan could comprehend what was happening, he heard his father's heart-wrenching shout.

"Yan'er, run!"

Yang Yan snapped back to reality as everyone's movements accelerated. He saw his father, sword in hand, locked in a struggle with the green-robed swordsman, his body already covered in wounds. His grandfather and mother were also flanking another swordsman in blue. His father's cries for him to run kept exploding in his mind, but it was too late. His body felt as if it were filled with vinegar, weak and limp, unable to move an inch.

The man in blue broke free from his grandmother and grandfather and charged toward Yang Yan. His grandfather lunged forward to block the man. The blue-robed man suddenly spun around and slashed his sword levelly. It was a deft strike, designed specifically to counter a pursuer from behind. In his desperation to protect his grandson, Yang Yan's grandfather had no time to dodge.

A head was cleanly severed. The strike was so fast that his grandfather's head flew forward in the direction he had been running, rolled across the ground, and came to a stop before Yang Yan.

Its eyes were still wide open, as if urging Yang Yan to escape.

Yang Yan thought he would scream, would cry out for his grandfather, but he did not. It was as if he were encased in something, and no sound could escape his heart.

Then, a massive force slammed into his chest, and his vision went black as he fell backward.

※※※

He did not know how long he was unconscious. When Yang Yan opened his eyes again, he was still in his home, the most familiar of places, the most familiar of surroundings.

But the moment he opened his eyes, he saw his father, mother, and sister lying on the floor, their hands and feet bound behind their backs. He struggled for a moment and found that his own hands were also tied. He then saw that his little brother's cradle had been placed in the center of the hall.

The tables and chairs had been pushed against the walls, clearing a space in the middle where the green-robed and blue-robed men stood. The man in blue was in his late twenties, thin and tall, with a prominent garlic-bulb nose. The man in green was in his late thirties, his eyes sharp and piercing, yet he was half a head shorter than Yang Shanshan.

Besides these two, there was one other whom Yang Yan had not noticed before.

He was a middle-aged man, over forty, wearing a far-traveler's cap and a short mustache. He was draped in a cloak that was black on the outside and red on the inside, his face an emotionless mask of frost. He sat in his grandfather's favorite chair. The furniture in the room was in disarray, yet the area around him was as tidy as ever. His hands were folded, and he said nothing, merely watching in silence.

"Who are you? Why are you doing this to us?" Yang Yan roared.

"Yan'er, be quiet!" Yang Zhengde hastily silenced him, then turned his head. "Let them go, this has nothing to do with them! They can't seek revenge! You know the rules; a grudge doesn't extend past the third generation. They're the fourth generation, they can't seek revenge!"

After speaking, Yang Zhengde did nothing but kowtow repeatedly. Tears welled in his wife's eyes as she kowtowed alongside him. Yang Shanshan was so frightened she could only sob, continually murmuring, "You have the wrong people, you must have the wrong people…"

Yang Yan, however, continued to curse furiously. "You killed my grandfather, you killed my grandfather! You damn butchers, I'll make you pay with your lives! Pay with your lives!"

"Shut up, you bastard!" the green-robed man shouted, kicking Yang Yan to the ground. Yang Yan continued to curse wildly, beyond Yang Zhengde's ability to restrain him.

The green-robed man casually shattered a bowl on the table, grabbed a handful of the shards, and shoved them into Yang Yan's mouth before forcing his jaw shut. The shards sliced through his mouth and pierced his cheeks. Yang Yan could no longer open his mouth, which filled with blood, and could only make muffled sounds.

The green-robed man laughed. "What was that? I can't hear you. A little louder!"

The blue-robed man said, "Since you know the rules of the martial world, you should have killed yourselves long ago. Why live on and bring disaster to your children? And make us search for so many years. Look what great face you have; even the Sect Master himself has come for you." He glanced at the black-robed man behind him as he spoke, his eyes seeking confirmation.

The black-robed man remained expressionless, his eyes holding neither pity nor the thrill of vengeance; rather, he seemed a complete outsider.

The blue-robed man raised his sword. "Which one should I start with?" 

He glanced at Yang Yan's mother. Knowing her fate was sealed, she gave a bitter smile to Yang Zhengde.

"Zhengde, let us be husband and wife again in our next life."

Yang Zhengde had only enough time to cry out "My wife!" before the blue-robed man's sword sliced her throat. Fresh blood spurted out, spraying across the table and the floor.

Yang Shanshan screamed. Seeing his mother's brutal death, Yang Yan felt a rage fill his chest, as if it would explode, yet he had no way to release it. He could only writhe and struggle with all his might. The ropes bit into his wrists and ankles, drawing blood, but he felt nothing.

The blue-robed man raised his sword toward Yang Zhengde again. "Now it's your turn."

The black-robed man coughed lightly. The blue-robed man's shoulders instantly tensed as if he had been struck from behind.

The green-robed man said in a low voice, "Kill the young ones first."

The blue-robed man finally understood. He said to Yang Zhengde, "There are three of them. You may keep one; the other two must die. Which one will you keep?"

Yang Zhengde, who had just watched his beloved wife die horribly, was stunned by the question. He stammered, "What… what did you say?"

The blue-robed man said, "A grudge does not pass the third generation, and a clan cannot be completely exterminated. I'll be generous and let you choose. Which one will you keep as the lone seed of your exterminated line?"

Yang Zhengde looked from Yang Yan to Yang Shanshan, then to the infant in the cradle, his gaze faltering. He could not help but glance at the black-robed man again. The black-robed man remained seated in silence, seemingly waiting for him to make his decision.

The blue-robed man said, "Or perhaps you can tell me which one to kill first?"

Yang Zhengde stammered, "I… I…"

It was an impossible choice; they were all his flesh and blood. Yang Zhengde's heart ached, but how could he possibly decide?

The blue-robed man said, "Can't choose? Then I'll choose for you."

He pointed his sword at Yang Yan. Yang Yan showed no fear. His mouth was full of blood and he could no longer speak, but his eyes were wide open, as if they would shoot fire.

The blue-robed man then pointed his sword at Yang Shanshan. "Or this one?"

Yang Shanshan shook her head and screamed, "No, don't kill me!"

The blue-robed man pressed her again. "Have you decided? Which one do you keep?"

Knowing that begging was useless, Yang Zhengde gritted his teeth and made his decision.

"Keep the youngest!"

He then turned his head away, unable to look at Yang Yan and Yang Shanshan.

The blue-robed man roared with laughter. "Did you hear that? Your old man doesn't want you anymore!"

With a flick of his sword, Yang Yan saw a spray of blood erupt from the cradle. He heard a single cry, "Waaah!" and then there was silence.

The blue-robed man laughed. "Interesting! How interesting!"

Yang Yan's mind went blank. The only thought repeating was, 'Little brother is dead? Little brother is dead, too?'

The little brother he had barely held a few times was dead, just like that? He could not see clearly into the cradle, but he clung to a sliver of hope for a miracle. Ignoring the blood on his face, he twisted his body, trying to get closer for a look. The blue-robed man watched him, and as he neared the cradle, kicked him in the stomach. Yang Yan rolled several times across the floor, howling in pain, but only whimpers escaped his lips as two streams of tears instantly flooded down his face. His mouth was full of porcelain shards, his cheeks were a mess of cuts, and his tears mingled with blood, soaking the floor beneath him.

Suddenly, the courtyard gate creaked open. Everyone looked toward the sound and saw Qin Jiuxian. He was carrying a live goose and had just pushed open the gate to this horrifying scene.

"Jiuxian, save me!" Yang Shanshan cried out upon seeing her lover. For the first time, Yang Yan felt a surge of hope for his future brother-in-law, praying that Qin Jiuxian would cut these three villains into a thousand pieces.

Qin Jiuxian dropped the goose and was about to draw his sword when the green-robed man shot in front of him. The green-robed man's sword was faster. Qin Jiuxian had barely drawn his blade when a sharp pain seared his arm. A long, bloody gash appeared, and blood gushed out as his longsword clattered to the ground.

At the mere sight of his own blood, all his earlier courage vanished completely. He quickly fell to his knees, clutching the green-robed man's leg, and wailed through his tears, "Mercy, my lord! I don't know anything! I didn't see anything!"

He was a novice who had only just received his Writ of Chivalry, with almost no real combat experience, let alone ever having taken a life. Faced with such a life-or-death struggle, his nerve had failed him before the fight even began. His legs gave out, and he knelt to beg for his life.

The green-robed man looked at Qin Jiuxian with contempt. Yang Shanshan, who had been crying out to her lover for help, was stunned into silence, her mouth agape. Her expression shifted from hope to disappointment, and finally, amidst Qin Jiuxian's pleas for mercy, her eyes lost their focus.

Yang Yan's heart turned as cold as if it had been plunged into a cellar of ice.

The green-robed man looked to the black-robed man, who gave a slight wave of his hand. The green-robed man then moved the tip of his sword away from Qin Jiuxian. As if granted a pardon, Qin Jiuxian cried out, "I won't tell anyone! I won't tell anyone!"

He did not even dare to glance at Yang Shanshan as he scrambled and crawled his way out.

The blue-robed man smiled at Yang Shanshan. "That's your lover? So useless. You'd be better off with me."

Yang Shanshan suddenly began to struggle, kneeling on the floor and kowtowing repeatedly, crying and pleading.

"My lord, let me be with you! Please, let me go, and I will serve you! I will make you very comfortable!"

Yang Yan and Yang Zhengde could scarcely believe their ears. Yang Zhengde's voice trembled. "Shan'er, what… what are you saying?"

Yang Shanshan cried, "You only ever cared about little brother! I don't want to die! I don't!"

She then turned to the blue-robed man, pleading, "My father doesn't want me, and I've always hated that little brother! I don't want to die with them!"

Yang Yan was both shocked and horrified. At that moment, he would rather die than show weakness to his enemies, yet he could never have imagined Yang Shanshan would make such a shameless offer to save her own life. He felt as if she had become an accomplice to these three, joining them in the slaughter of his own family.

Yang Zhengde roared, "To rape a woman and ruin her virtue is a crime condemned by all under heaven! You cannot do this!"

"I am willing! I am willing!" Yang Shanshan begged. "If you let me go, how would I dare to falsely accuse you!"

The blue-robed man swallowed and cast a questioning glance at the man in black. The black-robed man remained silent, a clear sign of his tacit approval—it seemed he would not object to any act that would further torture the Yang family.

Overjoyed, the blue-robed man was about to step forward when Yang Zhengde roared, "I will haunt you as a ghost!"

He lunged up and threw himself at the blue-robed man. Annoyed at the interruption just as he was about to enjoy himself, the blue-robed man ran his sword through Yang Zhengde's chest. Yang Shanshan cried out in alarm.

The blue-robed man kicked Yang Zhengde's body away, cursing, "You were asking for it!"

Yang Zhengde collapsed, his face streaked with tears. Though his breathing was faint, he continued to curse them. Not wanting his mood spoiled, the blue-robed man stabbed him several more times in the chest and abdomen. Blood pooled on the floor, and after a short while, he fell silent.

A furious rage surged through Yang Yan. His head felt as if it had swollen to ten times its size, and the world spun in chaos. A fire blazed in his chest while his stomach contracted violently. He wanted to vomit but could only dry heave, which disturbed the broken shards in his mouth, causing them to protrude further from his cheeks. But he felt no pain. He felt only heat, an intense, searing heat. The fire spread, consuming him from the inside out. He could only gasp for breath, his eyes wide, letting the heat vent from his eyes and mouth as bloodshot veins crawled across his vision.

The blue-robed man muttered a few curses, then turned to the man in green. "Should we finish that kid off first?"

The green-robed man said, "Are you stupid? If the kid's dead, why would she bother serving you?"

The blue-robed man replied, "Brother Shi Jiu is always so thoughtful, ha!"

The blue-robed man used his sword to cut the ropes binding Yang Shanshan. She quickly shed her clothes, revealing a pair of snow-white breasts. The blue-robed man dropped his trousers and said in a commanding tone, "Use your mouth."

He then forcefully pushed her head down, a look of satisfaction spreading across his face.

The green-robed man, Shi Jiu, lifted Yang Yan and laughed. "Still a virgin, are you? If you don't look now, you won't get another chance once you're dead."

Yang Yan did not want to look, but he did not turn his head away.

He had to memorize the faces of these three men. He had to! Even if he had to suffer in hell for ten million years, he would return for revenge!

No! He no longer feared hell, because this was hell!

He gripped the nail scissors he had gotten from the blacksmith's shop. He had hidden them in his sleeve, originally intending to snip Qin Jiuxian's belt when he was not looking. The sight of Qin Jiuxian had reminded him of them. The scissors had not been confiscated. He quietly slipped them from his sleeve. While Shi Jiu was engrossed in the spectacle before him, he began to cut at the ropes on his hands, bit by bit.

He had to fight back. Even knowing these men were powerful martial artists, he had to fight back, even if it meant death. He would plunge these nail scissors into every one of his enemies, and into Yang Shanshan!

In the past, his conflicts with Yang Shanshan had been mere sibling squabbles. But at this moment… at this moment, he truly hated her. He could not even tell if he hated these intruders more, or his own shameless sister.

The black-robed man seemed not to have noticed Yang Yan's actions. Just a little more, just a little more, and he would be free of his bonds and could take his revenge!

Yang Shanshan's hands rested on the blue-robed man's hips, her eyes closed as if she were concentrating on serving him. The blue-robed man leaned on his sword with his left hand while his right kneaded her chest.

He said, "Brother Shi Jiu, come over here, too. This bitch is hot enough for both of us to… oh…" He groaned softly, clearly enjoying himself.

Suddenly, the blue-robed man let out a bloodcurdling scream. Yang Shanshan raised her head, her mouth full of blood. She had obviously planned this. Her right hand shot out, grabbing the sword from the blue-robed man's grasp. She then threw her delicate neck onto the blade's tip and, with a violent twist of her head, sent a crimson spray from her severed throat into the air.

Through the shower of blood, Yang Yan saw Yang Shanshan's falling figure, her blood-smeared face seeming to smile at him.

Yang Yan stared in disbelief. He did not understand. He did not understand why his sister, who had been so desperate to survive just moments ago, would suddenly seek death. His legs were still bound, forcing him to his knees, his mind in utter turmoil. The blue-robed man was rolling on the ground, screaming in agony. Shi Jiu was stunned by the sudden turn of events. But all Yang Yan could see was blood.

Blood, everywhere. His grandfather's blood, his mother's blood, his little brother's blood, his father's blood, and the blood of Yang Shanshan, whom he had hated with all his soul just a moment before.

The blood of his entire family.

At that same instant, the ropes on Yang Yan's hands broke. He subconsciously tightened his grip on the scissors and, filled with a burning hatred, lunged and stabbed at Shi Jiu's stomach.

Shi Jiu had never expected the boy to break free and counterattack. With a soft thud, the scissors sank into his abdomen. Unfortunately, the small tool was not a proper weapon; the tip pierced an inch deep before his muscles stopped it. Yang Yan gave a savage twist, the blades churning flesh. Shi Jiu cried out, the intense pain driving him mad with fury.

"Let go!" he roared, swinging his sword at Yang Yan.

Yang Yan's eyes were wide as he prepared for death, but the blade stopped dead right before his forehead.

At some point, the black-robed man had moved to stand between him and Shi Jiu. The index and middle fingers of his right hand clamped down on Shi Jiu's sword, while his other hand pressed down on Yang Yan's shoulder.

Yang Yan felt an immense power from that palm, pinning him so that he could not move a single finger. His grip on the nail scissors began to fail. He refused to relinquish his only weapon, holding on with all his might, but in the end, he could not resist. His hands went limp, and he slumped to the ground.

The black-robed man glanced at Shi Jiu, an eyebrow twitching slightly as if in question.

Shi Jiu quickly said, "I'm sorry, Sect Master. I… I was angry… I didn't mean to… break the rules." He clutched his stomach and retreated to the side.

The black-robed man looked at Yang Yan and said faintly, "You have a good sister."

It was the only sentence Yang Yan had heard him speak all day. He had a northern accent. The black-robed man then gave a light push. Yang Yan slid back several feet until he slammed hard against the wall. His vision went black, and he passed out.

※※※

Again, he did not know how long he was unconscious. When Yang Yan opened his eyes again, all he could see was a sheet of red.

A blood-red.

He remembered everything that had happened before he lost consciousness, but for some reason, he felt calm, unexpectedly calm, as if none of it had ever happened.

His grandfather's body was headless. His sister's body was naked. His little brother lay in a blood-soaked cradle, no longer crying. And his father and mother lay on the floor.

Seeing all this, he remained calm. He felt as if all the grief and pain he would ever feel in his life had been completely spent.

Ignoring the pain in his mouth and all over his body, he squirmed and struggled to pick up the nail scissors, using them to cut the ropes on his feet.

He stood up. He did not embrace his parents' bodies and weep. He did not try to bury them. He did not even find a cloth to cover his naked sister. He did not take another step toward the corpses. Instead, bit by bit, he dug the shards of the broken bowl out of his cheeks and washed the wounds with water.

It hurt, but Yang Yan did not feel the pain. He tried to wash the blood from his eyes, but the red haze would not go away. He did not know that his eyes were now permanently bloodshot, that what he had witnessed yesterday had not only changed his mind but had also damaged his sight.

From that day forward, Yang Yan would see the world in red.

He remembered the secret compartment his father had told him about. He went to his father's room and searched, finally finding an identical compartment beneath the desk. From it, he retrieved a small wooden box. Inside lay a golden token. It was heavy in his hand, at least three or four taels. The front was cast with the four characters for _Immortal Cloud Command Token,_ and the back was exquisitely engraved with a pattern of radiant clouds.

How did his father come to possess something so valuable? And why was it hidden here?

Besides the token, the compartment also held an old, yellowed piece of paper, so fragile it felt as if it would disintegrate at a touch. On it were written the words _Yuefeng Gambling Den._

In the bottom right corner was a drawing of a gaunt, withered face, with the character for "Old" written crookedly beside it. The upper-right part of the first stroke was thick, the lower-left was thin, and the vertical line of the radical at the bottom pierced through it, making it look like a knife.

He returned to his own room and took out the pincushion hidden in his own secret compartment.

He did not know who those people were, or why they had let him live.

He did not know their so-called "rules."

He understood even less why Yang Shanshan, the sister who had bullied him his whole life, had been willing to die for him in the end.

And that smile before she died…

But he knew what he had to do. He would remember this day forever.

He packed his clothes, tucked the pincushion and the token securely into his robes, and then splashed the cooking oil from the kitchen all over the floor.

He raised a torch and took one last look at his home.

"My mother and wife, on whom can they rely?
My own fate here is unknown,
And their lives there hang by a thread.
Fear grips me, sweat pours like scalding water,
Anxiety sears me, my heart burns like fire!
My young wife, where is she now?
My old parents, lost in vain,
The grace of their toil I can never repay…"

Yang Yan threw the torch. He watched the flames swallow the small house, then melted into the twilight, leaving the place that had once been his home.

"A sorrowful cry—how can a hero's spirit be quelled, a hero's spirit be quelled?"

---

[^5]: The book is 《水浒传》 (Shuǐhǔ Zhuàn - Water Margin). The word for margin is "Margin" (浒 - hǔ) sounds exactly like "Tiger" (虎 - hǔ). Yang Yan, being an uneducated child, hears Shuǐhǔ and assumes it means "Water Tiger" because he associates the hero Lin Chong with the fierceness of a tiger.
