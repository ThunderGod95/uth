# Chapter 1: Vague and Unclear

Kunlun Year 67, Autumn, the eighth month.

On the night Ming Buxiang was born, his father, while boiling water, accidentally kicked over a pot of oil.

As fate would have it, a spark landed in the oil. Theirs was a thatched hut, and with the straw they had just gathered from yesterday's rain piled inside, a tongue of fire instantly sealed the main door.

The midwife panicked; without even cutting the umbilical cord, she pulled the infant out of the womb, placenta and all, clutched him to her chest, and tried to escape through a window. But she was a portly woman and only managed to squeeze her upper body through before her lower half became hopelessly stuck.

With her blocking the way, not only were Ming Buxiang's parents unable to escape, but their only source of air was cut off, and they were quickly overcome by the thick smoke.

The fire spread with terrifying speed, flames and dense smoke bursting from the cracks around the door. The midwife screamed for help, but then her hand slipped, and she dropped Ming Buxiang hard onto the muddy ground outside.

Villagers, drawn by the commotion, rushed to the scene; some hurried to find water to fight the fire while three or five strong men grabbed the midwife and pulled. Yet she was wedged so tightly that she wouldn't budge an inch. The midwife’s shrieks were utterly bloodcurdling until, after a violent convulsion, her eyes rolled back and she began to foam at the mouth.

Two of the burly men pulled together with all their might and finally yanked her from the window, but this only caused the smoldering fire inside the small hut to roar to life as fresh air rushed into the new opening.

The crowd gasped in shock. When they looked back at the midwife, they saw that while her upper body was intact, her lower half, from the waist down, had been cooked through, emitting the distinct aroma of roasted meat.

The villagers who had been fighting the fire vomited at the gruesome sight; for the next three months, the smell of pork fat made half the village sick.

In the midst of the chaos, a sturdy young woman picked up the infant from the mud and carried him away from the tragic scene.

This small village, located within Dengfeng of Zhengzhou[^1], was under the direct jurisdiction of Shaolin. Two days later, a Shaolin Proctor Monk named Liaoxin arrived to investigate the scene and could not help but frown. Such a bizarre fire, and the midwife's horrific death in particular, was truly a rare sight.

The villagers claimed the child was a cursed star, having brought death to his parents and the midwife at birth, and none dared to take him in. Master Liaoxin took the infant in his arms and noticed his gaze was dull, lacking the liveliness of a normal baby.

Unwrapping the swaddling cloth, he saw a large bruise on the back of the child's head and, upon inquiry, learned it was from when the midwife had dropped him. He then asked a few more questions. He was told only that the child was very easy to care for, rarely crying or fussing, eating when fed, and relieving himself normally. He was simply an orphan of the Ming family who had not yet been named.

Fearing the infant might have some hidden ailment, Liaoxin dared not place him with another family. Instead, he brought him back to the temple and reported the matter to Master Juejian, the abbot of the Hall of Upright Action.

Juejian simply said, "If there is a karmic tie, then let us accept him. Has he been named?"

Liaoxin replied, "He was born into calamity, perhaps as a matter of karma. Since his name is unknown, let us call him Buxiang."

Initially, Liaoxin found a family in the Buddha Capital to nurse Ming Buxiang. The child never cried, even when hungry. The wet nurse found this strange and pinched him a few times; he struggled slightly, then went still. She tickled the corner of his eye with a piece of straw, which brought tears but no sound. Only then did she nurse him. When Liaoxin came to visit, the wet nurse told him the boy was likely an imbecile and would be useless when he grew up, but Liaoxin simply gave her some silver and instructed her to take good care of him.

After the Kunlun council, the old imperial dynasty was replaced by nine great sects, known collectively as the Nine Great Families.

The Nine Great Families governed the world, and one of their resolutions was that "any who would dare proclaim themselves emperor shall be struck down by the world."

Since then, there were no more emperors, nor were there government offices. The Nine Great Families established their own sets of laws and each governed many smaller sects. These sects, in turn, managed local affairs, replacing the supervision of the old dynasty's government bureaus while also possessing the local gentry's understanding of and influence over regional customs.

It was as if the world had returned to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of over a thousand years ago. The Nine Great Families were like nine feudal lords, leading even more lesser lords beneath them, together maintaining order within the pass.

Liaoxin was a "Proctor Monk" of Shaolin. According to Shaolin regulations, clerical monks were stationed at every affiliated sect and temple within their jurisdiction. The proctor's duty was to investigate all violations of the law within their territory and apprehend the offenders. As a proctor, Liaoxin often needed to travel far on inspections. As soon as Ming Buxiang was weaned, Liaoxin would entrust him to the care of a neighboring monk, Liaoxu, whenever he had to leave.

For the first two years, no matter how Liaoxin tried to teach him, Ming Buxiang remained silent. Liaoxin began to suspect he was mute, and also that the wet nurse had been right—that Ming Buxiang was indeed an imbecile.

In the fourth year, during his morning recitation, Liaoxin paused for a breath after reading from the seventh section of the Diamond Sutra, "No Attainment, No Teaching."

Just as he was about to continue, Ming Buxiang, who had been listening beside him, suddenly opened his mouth and continued the passage, "Subhuti[^2], what do you think? Has the Tathagata[^3] attained the highest, most perfect enlightenment? Does the Tathagata have a teaching to proclaim..."

Just like that, Ming Buxiang finished reciting the entire section from memory. He then stared at Liaoxin with wide eyes, as if awaiting a reaction.

From that day on, Ming Buxiang could be said to know how to speak.

Liaoxin was both shocked and overjoyed. He was an orthodox monk[^4], different from the secular monks[^4], a true practitioner who sincerely upheld the precepts. He became convinced that Ming Buxiang had a karmic affinity with Buddhism and reported this extraordinary event to Juejian.

Juejian frowned. "Is this true?"

"How would your disciple dare to deceive you?"

"Your adopted son has an affinity for Buddhism, so he should naturally draw close to the Dharma and enter the temple to practice. Is that what you mean?"

Liaoxin heard the implication in his voice and flushed, hastily saying, "If the Abbot does not believe me, I can bring Xiang'er here."

Juejian waved his hand. "There is no need. You are diligent and hardworking, and I already intended to allow you to enter the Hall. There is no need to pressure your adopted son. A child should be allowed to follow his own nature."

Liaoxin had been a proctor monk outside the main Shaolin Temple, handling local violations. Entering a Hall meant joining one of the Four Courts or Eight Halls, part of the central authority, and dealing with Shaolin's internal affairs. Though still a proctor, his authority would be vastly different, and not only would he be able to move into the Shaolin Temple proper, but after death his ashes would be enshrined and cared for by Shaolin. It was a position many monks dreamed of, and the orthodox monks were especially fervent, viewing entry into a Hall as a supreme honor.

Liaoxin knew the abbot had misunderstood. He sighed but offered no explanation, simply moving with Ming Buxiang into a vacant two-room residence within the Shaolin Temple. The residence had a main hall that served as both a place for morning and evening recitations and a living room. Though small, it could accommodate two chairs, a tea table, and a few bookshelves.

From then on, Liaoxin handled his official duties in the Hall of Upright Action.

Although Ming Buxiang could now speak, he rarely did so. Liaoxin noticed that most of the time, the boy was watching—watching him, watching him chat with other monks, or watching other monks chat amongst themselves. Besides watching, he also listened. He listened to the evening drums and morning bells, to the sutra lessons in the morning and evening.

Worried the child was bored, Liaoxin made a point to buy some toys for Ming Buxiang when he went out. But whether it was kites, diablos, nine-linked rings, or pellet drums, Ming Buxiang seemed to merely handle them rather than play with them. Liaoxin could not tell if the child was brilliant or dull.

When he turned seven, one day, after quietly listening to Liaoxin finish his morning recitation as usual, Ming Buxiang suddenly asked, "What does 'All that has a form is illusory' mean?"

Liaoxin was instantly thrilled. Ever since Ming Buxiang was four, he had been certain the boy had an affinity for Buddhism. He had waited three years for Ming Buxiang to ask his first question, and for it to be another line from the Diamond Sutra filled him with both joy and trepidation. He was afraid his explanation would miss the point and hinder Ming Buxiang's cultivation, so he thought carefully before speaking.

"To understand that sentence, you must first understand the meaning of 'form,'" Liaoxin said. "Form is what our eyes see, our noses smell, our ears hear, our tongues taste, our bodies touch, and our minds think. All the superficial appearances of the world are forms."

"All the superficial appearances of the world?" When Ming Buxiang asked a question, he did not show a puzzled expression right away; it was only after a moment that he would 'squeeze out' a look of confusion. Liaoxin was already used to this. The child's emotions were always a bit delayed, and his expressions were very stiff, like a clumsy imitation.

Liaoxin continued, "That's right. Everything you perceive is not real; it is illusory, false. Form also includes other things. The attachments and thoughts in your mind are also forms. For example..."

Liaoxin picked up the wooden mallet used for chanting sutras and asked, "Is this mallet hard or soft?"

"Hard."

Liaoxin clasped the mallet between his palms and channeled the power of the Great Prajna Palm. Under the immense pressure, the mallet bent like a rice paddle.

"I, on the other hand, think it is soft," Liaoxin said.

Ming Buxiang nodded. "Hardness and softness are relative. I think it's hard, and you, Master, think it's soft."

"You thinking it is hard, and I thinking it is soft—these are both thoughts. Thoughts are also a kind of form. Preconceived notions are wrong."

Ming Buxiang asked again, "If all of this is false, what is real?"

Liaoxin answered, "When you become attached to the distinction between real and false, you have also become attached to a form. You have developed a discriminating mind about 'real' and 'false.'"

After a moment, Ming Buxiang squeezed out another confused expression.

"You don't need to distinguish between real and false, illusory and tangible. You are false, and rice is false, but when you are hungry, you still must eat. Understanding that all forms are illusory allows a person to not become arrogant in good times, nor to blame fate in bad times. To truly see through the illusory nature of reality is another realm entirely, one your master is still far from reaching."

With that, Liaoxin laughed heartily. A moment later, Ming Buxiang also showed a smile and asked, "Then who has reached that realm? Abbot Juejian?"

Liaoxin shook his head. "Even Abbot Juejian has not reached it."

"What about First Seat Juekong?"

"You actually remember First Seat Juekong's name. When did you ever see him?"

"I've heard Master mention him to others."

Juekong was the First Seat of the Universal Virtue Court, which was superior to the Hall of Upright Action, making him senior in both rank and prestige. However, Juekong was a 'secular monk'. Liaoxin believed that when it came to Buddhist principles, Juekong was far inferior to an 'orthodox monk' like himself.

"He is not even on par with Abbot Juejian."

"Then what about Abbot Juesheng?"

Ming Buxiang continued to list several names, but Liaoxin could not say for sure about any of them.

He only said, "There are many eminent monks and virtuous sages who have seen through the illusion of life and death. That is a remarkable realm. But you can't tell just by looking at their appearance; you have to look at their hearts. There are many false monks and sham Buddhas in this world, so you must learn to discern them. If you are interested in the Dharma, I will begin teaching you the sutras tomorrow."

Starting the next day, Liaoxin began by telling the story of the World-Honored One, then taught Ming Buxiang the "Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way." After that came the "Heart Sutra" and the "Diamond Sutra."

Ming Buxiang's aptitude for Buddhist scriptures was exceptional; he could grasp concepts from a single example and his thinking was unimpeded. Whenever he was tested, Ming Buxiang always answered fluently. The vacant look in his eyes gradually gave way to a spirited light, and his expressions were no longer as dull as before. Whenever Liaoxin's teachings reached a point of joyous praise, Ming Buxiang would also reveal a knowing smile.

At the age of eight, Ming Buxiang began to learn martial arts from Liaoxin, starting with basic stances and hand techniques, and gradually progressing to Arhat Fist and internal energy cultivation methods.

Ming Buxiang's talent for martial arts seemed to surpass even his aptitude for the sutras. He understood any technique after seeing it demonstrated just once. The cultivation of internal energy required a calm mind with few distractions, and once he entered a meditative state, his focus never wavered. Liaoxin understood then that the child he had brought back was not an imbecile, but a prodigy the likes of which was seen only once in a century.

On his twelfth birthday, Liaoxin called Ming Buxiang before him and asked, "You are twelve this year. Though you've grown up in the temple, you never go out to play besides practicing martial arts, and we rarely have visitors here. I have told you some of the temple's rules before. Do you remember them?"

Ming Buxiang nodded. One thing that hadn't changed since his childhood was his disinclination to speak.

Liaoxin took a small, palm-sized booklet from his robes. It was half a finger-joint thick, and written on it in small regular script were the four words, _Precepts for Buddhist Disciples_.

This was the book of rules that all in Shaolin, monk and secular fold alike, had to follow. It detailed three hundred and sixteen precepts, all written in small script. Every disciple was required to carry it at all times, never lose it, and know its contents by heart. When moving about the temple, if a senior randomly questioned them, they were to take out the booklet and answer.

"Keep this with you. Don't lose it." Liaoxin handed the _Precepts for Buddhist Disciples_ to Ming Buxiang.

"When disciples in the temple turn twelve, they must perform labor if they wish to remain. I've heard that the Shaolin Temple of the past referred only to the main hall where the abbot resided, and there was no division between orthodox and secular monks. Although they were involved with the martial sects, their actions were mostly chivalrous deeds. The Shaolin Temple of today has grown to the scale you see now, with a mix of orthodox and secular monks, and it is far from the pure place it once was. There are no women in the temple, and you..."

Liaoxin looked at Ming Buxiang's delicate and handsome face, his fair skin as smooth as a maiden's. He had heard of some of the sordid dealings within the temple.

"You must be careful in all things. If anyone forces you to do something you don't want to, you must resist. Your master will see that justice is done for you. Do you understand what I mean?"

"Is that kind of thing very pleasurable?"

Caught off guard by Ming Buxiang's question, Liaoxin paused for a moment before answering, "The great desires of humankind are for food and sex; it is in our nature. But indulging in lust is detrimental to one's cultivation."

"Have you ever done it, Master?"

Liaoxin burst out laughing. "Are you teasing your master? Your master became a monk as a child and has never thought about such things."

"Then how does Master know it is detrimental to cultivation, and how do you know what it means to be lost in it?" Ming Buxiang concluded, "Master speaks of many principles but has done very few things."

Liaoxin had never really considered this question himself. He had upheld the precepts since he was young and took pride in being an orthodox monk. There were a great many things he had never done in his life. What a shame it seemed...

The moment the thought "what a shame" arose, Liaoxin became instantly alert. To have a thought is to create karma. His adherence to the precepts was profound, and he immediately stood up and said, "I must recite the sutras. Starting tomorrow, you will clean the Hall of Upright Action with the others."

From that day on, the words "Master speaks of many principles but has done very few things" remained lodged in Liaoxin's mind, popping up from time to time. It was a seed that had fallen on barren ground, stirring restlessly.

※ ※ ※

The Hall of Upright Action was located in the Universal Virtue Court, to the right of the Shaolin Temple's main hall. After the previous dynasty, like other sects, the Shaolin Temple had expanded, adding many pagodas and halls. Looking straight ahead, a direct path led to the main hall. To the left, in order, were the Universal Virtue Court and the Unique Wisdom Court; to the right were the Observing Sufferings Court and the Earth Treasury Court. Each court had two halls. One main hall, four courts, and eight halls—this was the current structure of the Shaolin Temple.

The Shaolin Temple was different from other sects. Buddhism valued tranquility, so it was not located in a bustling, noisy area. There were no shops or residences nearby; the population of over ten thousand monks and disciples all lived within the temple.

Each court had a thousand monastic residences. True hustle and bustle could only be found five li from the temple, in the Buddha Capital. There, monks and commoners lived together in what was the largest city in the Mount Song area.

The Buddha Capital also had several hundred monastic residences for the monks who managed the Zhengzhou region but were not part of any Hall. This area was also known as the "Nameless Temple"—logically, any temple or sect managing a region should have a name, but this place was under the direct jurisdiction of the Shaolin Temple yet did not belong to any Hall, having no temple to affiliate with, hence the name 'Nameless Temple.' Ming Buxiang had lived there until he was four.

Ming Buxiang was assigned to clean the Hall of Upright Action. This was an entry-level chore, and with him were more than twenty other disciples, most of whom were monks of the "Ben" generation, one generation lower than Liaoxin. Among them were also lay disciples like Ming Buxiang. The disciple in charge was named Benyue. His face was covered in dark spots, and his peers secretly called him "Spotty Dog." He got this nickname because a few years ago, a spotted dog had run into the Hall of Upright Action and bitten him on the calf. They had laughed behind his back, saying it was a case of a spotty dog biting another spotty dog.

Out of compassion, Abbot Juejian had only chased the animal out of the temple. Some said that Benyue had snuck out of his room at night, lured the dog back with rat meat, and beaten it to death, dumping its body in the woods outside the temple. Others claimed Benyue had eaten the dog. Benyue's master was Liaowu, a secular monk, so naturally Benyue was also of the secular monk faction. The adherence of secular monks to the precepts was always questionable. In any case, no one thought Benyue would let the matter rest.

The first time Benyue saw Ming Buxiang, he frowned and asked, "Are you Master Liaoxin's adopted son?"

Ming Buxiang nodded.

Benyue spat on the ground and reached out to stroke Ming Buxiang's cheek with a teasing air.

"No wonder. So pretty. Master Liaoxin must dote on you very much, mustn't he?"

As soon as he finished speaking, several monks nearby burst into laughter, and surprisingly, Ming Buxiang laughed along with them.

Benyue cursed angrily, "What are you laughing at?" With that, he shoved Ming Buxiang. He was nearly twenty, much taller and larger than Ming Buxiang, and as an ordained monk, he was permitted to study the temple's more advanced martial arts. He pushed with great force, knocking Ming Buxiang to the ground.

Ming Buxiang did not get angry; he simply stood back up. Benyue asked again, "What are you laughing at?"

Ming Buxiang didn't speak. Benyue raised his voice and yelled, "Can't you talk?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head and said, "I can."

"Then what are you laughing at? Speak!"

Ming Buxiang did not answer.

Enraged, Benyue slapped Ming Buxiang so hard he stumbled.

"What are you laughing at? Say something!"

The spectating monks were startled and rushed forward to intervene, but Benyue was relentless.

"What are you laughing at? Are you looking down on me?"

With another crisp smack, a second red handprint appeared on Ming Buxiang's face.

The crowd hurriedly pulled Benyue away, pleading, "He's just a kid, and a simple-minded one at that. Don't mind him."

"Idiot! Serves you right to haul night soil (shit/dung)! Fu Yingcong, from now on he works with you!"

A fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth quickly stepped forward with an appeasing smile.

"Yes, yes! New kid, come with me, quick, don't waste time!

He grabbed a night soil bucket and pulled Ming Buxiang along.

Seeing the others still standing around, Benyue shouted, "What are you staring at! Get back to work!"

Fu Yingcong led Ming Buxiang away. Looking back to see the crowd disperse, he said to Ming Buxiang, "Why'd you have to go and offend that Spotty Dog the moment you arrived?"

"How did I offend him?" Ming Buxiang asked.

Fu Yingcong said, "What were you laughing at just now?"

"You all didn't find it funny, so why did you laugh?"

Hearing Ming Buxiang's reply, Fu Yingcong shook his head, thinking to himself that he really was an idiot.

"Here." He shoved the night soil bucket in his hands at Ming Buxiang. "There are over a thousand people in this Hall of Upright Action. If no one cleaned up, the shit would pile all the way to the Great Hall of Heroes. Don't think this work is disgusting and hard; it's a vital task."

He then asked, "Your master is Monk Liaoxin, so do you plan to become a monk in the future?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head, and Fu Yingcong couldn't tell if that meant "I don't know" or "no."

"You're so slow-witted. If you don't become a monk, you'll just get bullied staying in Shaolin. Didn't Monk Liaoxin tell you?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head again. Though he could speak, he seemed to prefer nodding and shaking his head.

Seeing that Ming Buxiang didn't understand, Fu Yingcong immediately began to show off.

"Why is Spotty Dog so arrogant? Isn't it just because of those few precept scars on his head? Let me teach you a rule. Although Shaolin doesn't require disciples to become monks, among the One Hall, Four Courts, and Eight Halls, which abbot or first seat isn't bald? A Daoist monastery might not only have Daoists, but a Buddhist temple is definitely full of monks. If you don't become a monk, the highest a lay disciple can get is an In-Hall Layman, assisting with official duties. You'll be like me, pushed around by monks every day. Dammit, the day I leave Shaolin, I'm going to pour a bucket of night soil on Spotty Dog's head and teach him a lesson!"

Seeing Ming Buxiang remain silent again, Fu Yingcong snapped, "Why aren't you talking again?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head, indicating he had nothing to say.

"If you don't talk, people will bully you. You have to speak up!"

"Say what?" Ming Buxiang asked.

"Just say whatever comes to mind!"

"Are you going to become a monk?"

Wasn't that the same question he had just asked him?

"What's so great about being a monk? You can't eat meat, you can't have fun with women. If it weren't for wanting to learn skills and get a Writ of Chivalry to make a name for myself out there, who would want to stay in this godforsaken place!" Fu Yingcong answered anyway. "Dammit, just my luck to be born in the wrong place. If I'd been born in Shandong, the Mount Song Sect wouldn't have so many rules!"

"The Mount Song Sect?" Ming Buxiang asked. "And what's a Writ of Chivalry?"

"You don't know?" Fu Yingcong put on an exaggerated look of surprise, glad for a rare chance to flaunt his meager knowledge.

"Actually, the Mount Song Sect is also under Shaolin's jurisdiction, but they're like brothers about to split the family property. It's understandable, really; they're Daoists, so we're not exactly close kin. But when people talk about Mount Song, they definitely think of Shaolin Temple first. Because of that stupid issue, they were clamoring to change their name to the Songyang Sect some forty years ago. I heard it caused a huge uproar, something about a 'Shao-Song Conflict.' In the end, they were thrashed by Shaolin and had to go back to being called the Mount Song Sect, but they moved their Daoist monastery to Shandong."

He continued, "As for the Writ of Chivalry, it's like an ordination certificate for heroes. Once you've completed your training, you can apply for a Writ of Chivalry from your sect, and then you're a great hero. The sect gives you a monthly stipend, and you can work as a bodyguard or join a sect, take on a post, and help the major sects manage local affairs, doing work that only heroes can do. But once you get the certificate, you have to follow the rules, especially your own sect's rules... Ai, let's not talk about it. Just my rotten luck to be born in Shanxi, sigh..."

Ming Buxiang listened intently. His master, Liaoxin, was a man of few words who was devoted to Buddhism. Besides chanting, teaching, and instructing him in martial arts, there were days when he wouldn't speak more than two sentences to his disciple. Furthermore, Liaoxin was convinced Ming Buxiang had a root of wisdom and was destined to become an orthodox monk in Shaolin, so he had never bothered to mention these tales of the martial world and the rules of the martial sects.

And so, it was not until today that Ming Buxiang's words gradually became more frequent.

※ ※ ※

A few nights later, as Ming Buxiang was sleeping in his room, he suddenly heard a low growl that sounded almost like a sigh. He got up and gently pushed the door open a crack. The window was ajar, and moonlight streamed in, faintly illuminating a figure pacing back and forth. It was his master, Liaoxin. But Liaoxin's steps were quick and anxious, yet so light they seemed to barely touch the ground, as if he were deeply troubled by something. A single oil lamp flickered in the hall before the Buddha statue, its weak flame seeming as though it might be extinguished by his footsteps at any moment.

After pacing for a while, Ming Buxiang once again heard Liaoxin's heavy, sighing breath. He saw him push the door open and leave, though where he was going in the middle of the night was a mystery. Ming Buxiang waited quietly. About half a shichen later, Liaoxin returned to the room. He was soaked to the bone, his monk's robe tied around his waist, his upper body bare, revealing a frame of powerful, well-honed muscles that glistened like jade in the moonlight. Ming Buxiang saw him enter his room and did not see him come out again.

Ming Buxiang never asked Liaoxin what had happened. Nor did he ever ask on the subsequent occasions when such incidents occurred.

Several months later, after master and disciple had finished their evening recitation and were about to retire, Ming Buxiang suddenly said, "Master, wait." He walked quickly into his room and emerged holding a longevity peach bun.

"Where did this come from?" Liaoxin asked, astonished.

"I did Fu Yingcong's share of the work for him," Ming Buxiang answered. "He bought it for me outside the temple."

He held it up with both hands, offering the peach bun to Liaoxin.

"What is the meaning of this?"

"Today is your fortieth birthday."

Liaoxin was deeply moved. His eyes and nose stung, and he had to take a small breath to suppress his emotions.

"You are very thoughtful. How did you know?"

"I saw your ordination certificate and that Writ of Chivalry while cleaning the room. They both have your birthday written on them."

"I mean this matter of giving gifts." Liaoxin's face hardened. "Where did you learn such a thing?"

"A few days ago, I saw someone give a gift to Abbot Juejian. When I asked, I learned it was the Abbot's birthday."

It was common for those in high positions within the temple to receive extravagant gifts from sycophants on their birthdays and other holidays, a custom Liaoxin deeply despised. Of course, Ming Buxiang's display of filial piety could not be compared to those people's actions. He accepted the peach bun but saw a light that seemed to shine from Ming Buxiang's eyes, a look of considerable excitement.

"Master, please eat it."

Liaoxin replied, "I do not eat after noon. You know this."

"Then why am I allowed to eat supper?" Ming Buxiang asked. Like all children, he had an endless supply of questions.

"You are at an age where your bones are still growing, and you have not been ordained or taken the precepts, so you are not bound by this rule."

"If you were starving to death, but it was past the hour, could you still not eat?"

"To break a precept for the sake of survival—the moment that thought arises, you have already created a convenient excuse for yourself. The physical body is suffering. If one truly starves to death, it is also a form of liberation." Liaoxin thought to himself that he wasn't sure if the boy could understand such a concept.

"Master, you often speak of letting go of the self. Isn't this also a form of attachment?"

Liaoxin was taken aback.

Ming Buxiang continued, "You taught me that people are illusory, and rice is illusory, but a person must eat when they are hungry. We eat in order to cultivate. If every infant saw through the nature of reality at birth, they would starve to death. How could they cultivate then?"

Liaoxin said, "Without cultivating, how can one see through the nature of reality?"

Ming Buxiang said, "Without eating, how can one cultivate?"

Liaoxin said, "Unless one has cultivated to the stage of grain avoidance, one must eat. Not eating after noon is to uphold the precepts."

Ming Buxiang said, "But you also said one cannot break the precepts even if it means starving to death?"

"Since one is cultivating by upholding the precepts, the precepts must naturally come first."

"Is attachment to the precepts not a form of attachment?"

Liaoxin wanted to say no, but felt it was wrong. He wanted to say yes, but that also felt wrong. After a moment's thought, he said, "That comes from the heart. When one truly reaches a state of non-attachment, one is naturally not attached to the precepts."

Ming Buxiang replied, "How does one know they have reached that state?"

"Master has not yet reached that state. When one reaches it, one will naturally know."

Ming Buxiang asked again, "Does Master know anyone who has reached that state?"

Liaoxin could not answer this question. Seeing his hesitation, Ming Buxiang said, "Master, have you never considered that you must first try to let go of an attachment in order to truly let it go?"

Liaoxin was stunned once again.

Ming Buxiang said, "This peach bun will spoil by tomorrow. I'll go throw it away."

You eat it. The thought is enough. In the future, do not engage in these empty formalities."

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "This is Master's longevity peach, not mine. Your disciple is being attached."

Liaoxin chuckled, then watched as Ming Buxiang, with a dejected look, took the peach bun and turned to leave. A feeling of pity rose in his heart, and he called out, "Wait a moment."

Ming Buxiang turned back. Liaoxin hesitated for a moment, then shook his head and said, "It's nothing." Ming Buxiang turned to go again, but Liaoxin called out to him once more. After a long pause, he finally said, "Come here."

Ming Buxiang walked back to stand before Liaoxin, who stared at the longevity peach, lost in thought for a long time.

Ultimately, he reached out, broke off a small piece from the longevity peach bun, and placed it in his mouth. He abstained from eating after noon, but it was now the dead of night. Though the fast was familiar, this small bite still tasted exceptionally sweet and fresh, a world apart from his usual fare.

"This one bite is to honor your filial piety," Liaoxin said. "This way, Master can't be considered attached, can I?"

Ming Buxiang smiled faintly and said, "Master has already broken his precept for my sake, so why not eat the whole thing? What difference is there between one bite and one bun?"

Liaoxin shook his head. "You know your master's intention is not about eating much or little. This is what it means to follow one's heart. Do you understand?"

Ming Buxiang chuckled. "Following one's heart means there's reason in eating or not eating. The first bite, the second, the third—what difference is there?"

Liaoxin felt he had a point and was about to reach out when a sudden alarm in his heart made him pull his hand back.

"It's rare to see you so sharp-tongued... Go on, go to sleep."

Ming Buxiang placed the longevity peach bun on the table, gave a salute, and returned to his room to rest.

That night, Liaoxin tossed and turned in his bed, feeling an unusual hunger, a sensation he had not experienced in over ten years.

After the Laba Festival, a great snow fell upon the Shaolin Temple. The master and disciple swept the snow from the front of their dwelling, and Liaoxin said to Ming Buxiang, "Cultivation is just like this. Each person must sweep the snow from their own doorstep; to hope for others to help you is unrealistic."

Ming Buxiang countered, "Does that mean we should ignore the frost on others' tiles?"

Liaoxin said, "Look at this courtyard. The Universal Virtue Court alone has over a thousand monastic dwellings. Could you sweep them all? If everyone diligently swept their own doorstep, everything would naturally be clean."

"Is Master suggesting the World-Honored One was meddlesome?"

Liaoxin laughed heartily. "When it comes to cultivation, the World-Honored One can only point you in the right direction, like giving you a broom and dustpan. You still have to sweep the floor yourself. Sweeping snow is just a metaphor; you can help someone sweep their snow, but you cannot help them cultivate."

Ming Buxiang said, "So, if one's cultivation is insufficient, you can't blame anyone else?"

Liaoxin nodded. "The world is full of demonic trials to test the human heart. These trials are not karmic hindrances, but bodhisattvas of adversity. Only by enduring them can one achieve complete merit."

Gazing at the accumulated snow on the eaves, Ming Buxiang seemed to understand.

After the New Year came the Beginning of Spring, and after that, the Rain Water. The twenty-first of the second month was the birthday of the Bodhisattva Puxian, a most important day for the Universal Virtue Court. Not only were sutras chanted for seven days and nights, but the sutra monks of the Unique Wisdom Court would also hold lectures to study the Dharma together.

In previous years, Liaoxin had always left Ming Buxiang at home while he went to the assembly to chant sutras, but this year Ming Buxiang had turned twelve, so Liaoxin excused himself from his chanting duties to take him to listen to the lectures.

This was the first time Ming Buxiang had heard someone other than Liaoxin expound upon the Dharma.

On the eighth day of the third month, Liaoxin called Ming Buxiang to him.

"I have to go to Mount Song for some business. I leave tomorrow. While I'm away, you must take good care of yourself."

This 'Mount Song' was not, of course, the geographical location, but the Mount Song Sect which had relocated to Shandong.

"Will you be gone long?" Ming Buxiang asked.

"A month at the earliest, and I'll be back to take you to the Buddha Capital for the Buddha's Birthday. At the latest, I'll still be back in time to have rice dumplings with you."

Afterward, Liaoxin gave him some instructions, mostly admonishing Ming Buxiang not to be lazy in his absence.

That night, just as Liaoxin was about to sleep, Ming Buxiang suddenly pushed the door open and came in.

"What is it?" Liaoxin asked.

"It's been many years since I slept with Master. I want to sleep with you tonight," Ming Buxiang said. "You're leaving on a long journey tomorrow."

Since his promotion to Hall Monk, Liaoxin had mostly handled hall affairs; even when he left, he would return within three days. Ever since Ming Buxiang was old enough to remember, the two had never been separated for so long.

Liaoxin smiled.

"So big, and still acting spoiled." He beckoned with his hand. "Come here."

Ming Buxiang got into bed and curled up in Liaoxin's arms, falling asleep a short while later. Liaoxin looked at the handsome and elegant youth in his embrace, and thinking of the past, he could not help but sigh.

'This child has never been a cause for worry.'

As Ming Buxiang slept soundly, he reached out and held Liaoxin just as he had as a child. Liaoxin closed his eyes, but his thoughts surged, and sleep would not come.

The next day, as if he had a premonition, Liaoxin said to Ming Buxiang, "If anyone bullies you these next few days, endure it and be patient. Do not get into arguments. Wait for Master to return to handle things, understand?"

Ming Buxiang nodded, showing he understood.

One month later, on the twenty-fifth of the fourth month, seven bodies were discovered within the jurisdiction of Mount Song in Shandong; all were monks who had been ordered to travel to Mount Song. They had been killed on their return journey, and among them, only Liaoxin's body was missing.

Although Liaoxin was not among the dead, no one in the world ever saw him again. He had vanished mysteriously, his whereabouts unknown forevermore.

---

On the day Liaoxin left the Shaolin Temple, Ming Buxiang went to the Hall of Upright Action to perform his labor duties as usual. When Benyue saw Ming Buxiang, his expression turned fierce, and he kicked a manure bucket at him, striking Ming Buxiang squarely in the chest.

Benyue was heard cursing, "Your master is so great, is he? Doesn't even show respect for First Seat Juekong?!"

Ming Buxiang remembered Liaoxin's instructions from that morning and understood the situation. He silently picked up the bucket and turned to leave.

Benyue rushed forward to block his path, scolding, "You don't even bow when you see a senior brother? The master has no respect, and the disciple has no manners. A pair of worthless curs!"

With that, he slapped Ming Buxiang across the face.

Ming Buxiang neither talked back nor retaliated, simply walking away. This enraged Benyue further, and he kicked him again from behind. This kick was powerful, landing on his lower back; Ming Buxiang's body pitched forward, but he still ignored him as other monks nearby hurried to restrain Benyue.

Seeing Ming Buxiang about to get away, Fu Yingcong quickly caught up to him.

"The more you ignore him, the more he'll bully you," he said.

Ming Buxiang replied placidly, "When the heart is unburdened, one is truly free."

"Are you really not angry?" Seeing Ming Buxiang just keep walking without a reply, Fu Yingcong continued, "I heard that after the Four Courts' meeting yesterday, First Seat Juekong issued a decree, and your master openly opposed it, getting into a conflict with him. Did you know about this?"

"My master didn't mention it."

Ming Buxiang stopped and looked at Fu Yingcong. "He bullies you just as much. Why don't you go?"

Fu Yingcong's face flushed, and he lowered his head. "I... I'm turning eighteen in three months. Once I pass the martial trial and receive my Writ of Chivalry, I'll be leaving the Shaolin Temple. Why should I bother picking a fight with him?"

"You won't pass the trial," Ming Buxiang said.

Fu Yingcong felt a pang of guilt but refused to admit it. "Who says I won't pass? You've never even seen what I can do!"

Ming Buxiang shook his head and kept walking.

"Wait, your robes are covered in footprints. Take them off and dust them down," Fu Yingcong said, hurrying to keep up. "If the other senior brothers ask about it, it'll just cause more trouble."

Ming Buxiang put down the manure bucket, took off his outer robe, and patted it a few times. Fu Yingcong took the robe from him, saying, "Let me." He turned and dusted it off a few more times until it was clean before handing it back. Ming Buxiang put it back on, picked up the bucket, and went back to his work.

After the two had finished emptying all the night soil, they returned to the Hall of Upright Action. Usually, after Benyue's inspection, everyone would disperse to the dining hall for the midday meal. On this day, however, Benyue gathered all twenty-odd monks. The others seemed prepared for it; only Ming Buxiang was unaware of what was happening as he stood waiting in line.

A short while later, an old monk of about fifty arrived, whom Ming Buxiang recognized as Juejian, the abbot of the Hall of Upright Action. Benyue first offered his greetings, after which Juejian asked, "Today's examination is on the 'Precepts for Buddhist Disciples.' Was everyone properly informed?"

"How would I dare be negligent in a matter instructed by the abbot? I made sure to inform all my junior brothers. The abbot may verify this."

Several disciples who were in league with Benyue chimed in, "It's true, senior brother Benyue told us."

Other disciples remained silent. Although Ming Buxiang knew nothing of the matter, he did not expose the lie.

"Well then, everyone take out your copies of the 'Precepts for Buddhist Disciples.'"

Everyone took out their small booklets. Ming Buxiang felt inside his robe for his copy but could not find it. He looked toward Fu Yingcong, who had a guilty look on his face and turned away, avoiding his gaze. From his own robes, Fu Yingcong produced a small, vaguely familiar booklet, and Ming Buxiang understood at once.

Benyue shouted, "Ming Buxiang, where are your 'Precepts for Buddhist Disciples'?"

"I lost it." Ming Buxiang looked back at Benyue and said lightly, "I threw it away."

His words caused an uproar, and Benyue, seeing his chance, roared in anger, "Lost it? For a disciple of Shaolin, the precepts come first! Did your master not teach you to keep the 'Precepts for Buddhist Disciples' on your person at all times, to review them constantly, and to cultivate your character? How dare you be so brazen?!"

He then turned to Juejian and said, "Abbot, this Ming Buxiang is a roguish character and difficult to teach. You must punish him severely, otherwise there's no telling what other trouble he'll cause!"

Juejian walked over, looked at Ming Buxiang and asked, "You are Liaoxin's disciple?"

Ming Buxiang nodded.

"Liaoxin has always been steadfast and prudent in upholding the precepts. Do you know why?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "Before the World-Honored One entered nirvana, Ananda asked him: 'While the Buddha was with us, we had the Buddha as our teacher. Now that the Buddha is gone, who shall be our teacher?' The World-Honored One answered: 'Take the precepts as your teacher.' That is why my master rigorously observes the precepts and is exceptionally prudent."

Hearing his refined speech, Juejian asked again, "The Shaolin Temple requires disciples to carry the 'Precepts for Buddhist Disciples' at all times so that during occasional examinations, they can refer to it. This is for the same reason. Since you understand this principle, why did you throw it away?"

"The disciple only said he threw it away, not that he did not bring it with him."

Juejian was quite surprised and asked, "What do you mean by that?"

Ming Buxiang said, "The three hundred and sixteen articles of the precepts are engraved upon my heart. That is how I have brought them with me."

Benyue cursed loudly, "You're saying you've memorized them all? What kind of nonsense are you spouting?"

Ming Buxiang pressed his palms together and replied, "I invite the abbot to test me."

Juejian knew that Benyue had a habit of bullying newcomers and suspected there was more to the story, but seeing Ming Buxiang's confidence, he asked, "What is the seventy-seventh precept?"

"A disciple of Buddha shall have few desires and abstain from licentiousness, forbidding lewd and evil acts. Fornicating with the wives and daughters of others and ruining their reputation results in the loss of one's Writ of Chivalry, expulsion from the temple, capture for trial, and punishment upon judgment."

"The tenth precept?"

"Without the permission of one's mentoring master, one may not accept disciples. Without the approval of the eight hall abbots, an outer disciple may not be taught the advanced martial arts recorded in the Hall of True Insight."

Juejian picked a few more precepts to ask about, and the other monks, listening while flipping through their booklets, found that he was correct to the very word. They were all stunned. Juejian too was deeply astonished.

'Liaoxin often said this child had an affinity with the Buddha. I never expected him to be so brilliant.'

Benyue said angrily, "You claim to have it memorized, so I'll ask you: what is written on the fifth line of the thirty-seventh page?"

This was clearly a malicious challenge, but unexpectedly, Ming Buxiang answered without hesitation, "Precept two hundred and seventeen: A disciple of Buddha must not be greedy for money and property, nor compete with the common people for them."

Benyue checked his booklet and found it to be correct, his mouth agape in shock. Ming Buxiang continued, "The sixth character on the fifth line of the twelfth page is 'not'; the seventh character on the tenth line of the thirteenth page is 'fall'; the ninth character on the second line of the sixteenth page is 'into'; the eighth character on the sixth line of the nineteenth page is..."

At this, Ming Buxiang fell silent. Juejian took out his own copy of the precepts from his robes and turned to the nineteenth page, seeing that the character Ming Buxiang spoke of was 'text'. The four characters linked together formed "not fall into text."

Juejian understood. This was Ming Buxiang's way of saying that he observed the precepts with his heart and did not rely on the written word, which was why he had 'thrown away' his copy of the precepts.

"Remarkable. It is rare to see such a memory. However, despite your memory, you should not have thrown the precepts away. You must know that the classics are the source of the law. To cast them aside out of self-perceived intelligence is a sign of arrogance," Juejian said. "If you were to memorize all the texts in the scripture repository, would you then burn it all to the ground? What would future generations have to rely on?"

Benyue quickly added, "Exactly! This person has always been arrogant. The abbot should discipline him, lest he becomes conceited and looks down on everyone!"

Ming Buxiang bowed respectfully and replied, "This disciple will remember your teachings."

"The other disciples should also be like Ming Buxiang, memorizing the precepts and observing them with their hearts." With that, Juejian began to examine the other disciples on the precepts. Benyue, seeing that Juejian had no intention of pursuing the matter further, could not hide the resentment on his face.

From that day on, Juejian took a special interest in Ming Buxiang. He observed him and knew that he never missed a day of chanting. After finishing his labor duties, he would return to his room and not emerge again until the evening meal, after which he would extinguish his lamp and sleep, rarely interacting with others.

A little over a month later, grim news came from Mount Song. Seven bodies had been found, with only Liaoxin missing from the group. The bodies were transported back to the Shaolin Temple, where the Proctor Monks of the Universal Virtue Court's Hall of Upright Action conducted an autopsy. Even before the results were out, rumors were already flying.

Juejian sent someone to inform Ming Buxiang of Liaoxin's disappearance. Ming Buxiang merely nodded and closed his door.

Before he knew it, the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching. During every festival, a large number of gifts were sent to the Hall of Upright Action. Not wanting his own quarters to be tainted by such worldly things, Juejian had the gifts placed in the main hall. After the festival, he would send half of the gifts to the Earth Treasury Court's Hall of True Contemplation for temple use, and the other half would be distributed among the hall monks as a reward. Those monks who received the offerings, though they chanted the Buddha's name and claimed to be unworthy, had smiles playing at the corners of their eyes. Only a select few were able to refuse the gifts entirely, forwarding their alms to the Hall of True Contemplation.

'How did the Shaolin Temple become like this?' Juejian wondered. 'Did it start eighty-some years ago with the Kunlun council, or over forty years ago with the Shao-Song Conflict, when secular monks were brought in?'

The change was like water dripping on a stone; each erosion was imperceptible, but over time, its original appearance was lost. Forty years ago, secular monks were not even allowed to serve in the halls, but now two of the first seats in the Four Courts were secular monks. In another twenty years, what would it become?

Juejian dared not think further. He felt that the power struggle between the secular and orthodox monks in the Shaolin Temple was gradually brewing into a storm. Should he stand at the center of that storm, or should he retreat from the rapids? He could never make up his mind on this question.

At this point, the storm was likely no longer just brewing, but already taking shape. Of the eight hall monks sent to Mount Song, half were orthodox and half were secular. The bodies of the seven deceased monks were brought back to the Shaolin Temple, and the autopsy from the Hall of Upright Action yielded a terrible result. All seven had died from Shaolin martial arts, and more specifically, from each other's signature techniques. If a conclusion had to be drawn, it would be that the orthodox and secular monks had fought, resulting in fatal injuries, with only Liaoxin surviving and fleeing to escape punishment.

The hall monk who performed the autopsy dared not draw a conclusion and reported it to Juejian. Juejian ordered another examination, but the monk replied that the wounds were clear, and another autopsy would yield the same result. The official report from the Hall of Upright Action now sat on Juejian's desk, needing only his signature.

Fortunately, this year happened to be the decennial Kunlun council, where a new alliance leader was to be chosen. First Seat Juekong was representing the abbot at Kunlun Palace, a formality that would buy some time.

But how would First Seat Juekong handle this upon his return? The best solution would be to issue a verdict of "culprit unknown, cause of death under investigation," and wait until Liaoxin was found to ascertain the truth before deliberating further. If Liaoxin was already dead, the matter would be closed.

But would things really go so smoothly?

Juekong was the leader of the secular monks. Would he report the truth, or would he conceal it? Currently, secular monks made up over sixty percent of the Shaolin Temple, yet they held only five seats in the Four Courts or Eight Halls. While there was no explicit rule, it was an unwritten tradition to pass the abbot's position to an orthodox monk, not a secular one. Was First Seat Juekong truly dedicated to Shaolin, or did he have his own selfish motives?

'Secular monks cannot be trusted,' Juejian thought. 'These monks who shave their heads for reasons other than faith, who knows what they are plotting?' This document was the perfect  tool for stirring up trouble.

If he were to bypass the Universal Virtue Court and submit the report directly to the abbot, he could already guess the conclusion once Juekong returned and convened the Four Courts: Liaoxin murdered his fellow monks and betrayed the temple.

Liaoxin would never betray the temple, of that he was certain. But this outcome would both avoid a conflict between the orthodox and secular factions and represent a consensus between the Universal Virtue Court and the other three courts, making it difficult for Juekong to stir up trouble later. It was the cleanest solution. But by reporting over his superior's head, he would inevitably clash with First Seat Juekong, and Liaoxin would have to bear the consequences. Regardless of the truth, the man Liaoxin could not and would not ever appear again, and he himself would step from the edge of the storm into its very center.

As for what the truth really was, he believed that in this world of martial sects, no fewer than seven people died every day.

Juejian suddenly felt exhausted. Since becoming the abbot of the Hall of Upright Action, he had been burdened with heavy duties for over a decade. There were so many social obligations and formalities to attend to. He chanted fewer sutras and signed more documents, had less peace of mind and more worries. At critical junctures, he had to deceive his superiors and act out of expediency.

After all his years of cultivation, he was instead drifting further and further from the Buddha. Sometimes he wanted to wash his hands of it all, but then he would think, 'If I do not enter hell, who will?' Which orthodox monk did not wish to focus on their cultivation? Could they really hand over the entire Shaolin Temple to the secular monks?

But where on earth had Liaoxin gone?

He had once thought highly of him, until a few years ago when Liaoxin reported that Ming Buxiang could recite the Diamond Sutra at the age of four. He had a sudden realization: the solemn observance of precepts and the life of asceticism were just a facade. At his core, Liaoxin was still a worldly man who sought fame and profit, one who dreamed of rising through the ranks. What kind of suffering must a four-year-old child endure to be forced to memorize the Diamond Sutra? Thinking of this, Juejian had distanced himself from him.

Thinking back now, Liaoxin had not been exaggerating, and he himself had ultimately misjudged him.

Then again, it was not impossible that the orthodox and secular monks had fought, and Liaoxin had killed them before fleeing. If Liaoxin had broken the precepts against killing and anger, then his judgment of him had not been entirely wrong after all.

But what of Liaoxin's disciple, that child? How would he fend for himself in the Shaolin Temple?

Juejian summoned a disciple and had him bring Ming Buxiang over.

'Liaoxin's affairs must not affect this child,' Juejian thought, looking at the autopsy report on his desk. 'No matter what, I must ensure this child's safety in the temple. We can decide what to do with him after he comes of age.'

A short while later, the disciple led Ming Buxiang in. Ming Buxiang first bowed, and after asking his age and praising his intelligence, Juejian inquired, "Are you accustomed to performing your labor duties in the Hall of Upright Action?"

"There is nothing I am not accustomed to."

"That child Benyue is petty and refuses to listen to advice. I have noticed he often bullies you, is that right?"

"My master taught me that all bodhisattvas of adversity are an aid to one's cultivation. Besides, he has never truly bullied me."

Juejian was greatly surprised by this answer and couldn't help asking, "How can you say he has not bullied you?"

"My freedom comes from my own heart and does not depend on external things. How can he bully me?"

"When he hits you, do you not feel pain?"

"The pain is temporary. It has not injured my bones or my life."

"And what if it did injure your life and bones?"

"Then it would no longer be a matter of bullying. If my life is threatened, I will naturally have to fight back."

Juejian praised him, saying, "I did not believe it when Liaoxin spoke of you. I nearly let a piece of fine jade be buried in rotten earth."

Ming Buxiang said, "The abbot's words further prove that senior brother Benyue is a bodhisattva of adversity."

Juejian said, "I cannot let him continue to bully you. Do you have any intention of becoming a monk?"

"This disciple has not yet considered it."

"You possess Buddhist wisdom. When the time is right, you will naturally make your decision. I plan to transfer you to perform labor duties elsewhere. Is there a place you would like to go?"

"This disciple would like to go to the Unique Wisdom Court."

Juejian uttered an "Oh?" and asked, "Why the Unique Wisdom Court?"

Ming Buxiang said, "All of the temple's scriptures are in the Hall of True Insight's scripture repository, and the sutra monks are also in the Unique Wisdom Court. If I encounter any difficulties, it would be easy to ask for guidance."

Juejian nodded, thinking, 'This child is not only gifted but also knows how to strive for excellence. What's most rare is that he is not complacent or arrogant.'

He replied, "Very good. Then starting tomorrow, you shall report to the Unique Wisdom Court. I will inform them and assign you to clean the scripture repository."

Ming Buxiang asked, "Will I have to move to the Unique Wisdom Court?"

"There are empty monastic dwellings there. If you wish to move, you may."

"Does the abbot believe my master will not be coming back?"

Juejian was startled. This child truly could not be underestimated; in just a few sentences, he had been led into a trap. But considering it was out of concern for his master, an act of filial piety, Juejian could only say, "If your master returns, I will inform you."

After speaking, Juejian noticed that Ming Buxiang did not reply, but simply looked at him with a pair of clear eyes, which made him feel uneasy. However, Ming Buxiang did not ask anything further, only saying, "If the abbot has no other instructions, this disciple will take his leave."

"Wait a moment." Juejian rose and went to the main hall next door, selected a string of vegetarian rice dumplings from the gifts, and returned to hand them to Ming Buxiang.

"Take this string of vegetarian rice dumplings with you."

Ming Buxiang shook his head and did not reach for them. Juejian asked curiously, "You don't like rice dumplings?"

"These are gifts from the outside, correct?" Ming Buxiang asked.

"What of it?" Juejian retorted.

"My master said that what is sent to the Hall of Upright Action are not gifts, but debts. Once a debt is accepted, no matter how many hands it passes through, it will have to be repaid with interest in the future. Whoever eats this string of rice dumplings will have to repay the debt of the person who sent them, only they won't know in what way it will be repaid. This is called karma."

Juejian chewed on these words carefully and felt he was beginning to understand. His generosity was merely passing these dirty things meant for currying favor onto the others in the Hall of Upright Action. It was karma; it always had to be repaid. He was just letting others bear the negative karma he had sown.

Letting others bear his negative karma—was that not precisely what he was preparing to do? For a moment, Juejian even felt that Ming Buxiang had seen through his intentions.

But that was impossible. Ming Buxiang was just a child...

"You may go. Report to the Unique Wisdom Court starting tomorrow," Juejian said to Ming Buxiang.

After Ming Buxiang left, Juejian thought for a long time, then summoned a disciple and instructed, "Send all the gifts to the Earth Treasury Court."

"Shouldn't we keep some?" the disciple asked in surprise.

Juejian saw the disappointment in the disciple's eyes, but he was even more disappointed in this group of disciples. He replied, "We're not keeping any. From now on, refuse all gifts that are sent."

On the autopsy report, Juejian wrote his conclusion: "Death likely due to fighting, pending further investigation." He then signed his name. He had decided to submit the report to the Universal Virtue Court and let First Seat Juekong handle the matter. The conflict between the orthodox and secular monks of Shaolin was their collective karma; Liaoxin could not be made to bear it alone. Even if they glossed over it today, it would still have to be resolved in the future.

If this was a storm, then he should throw himself into it.

For the next few years, Ming Buxiang remained in the Unique Wisdom Court, sweeping the floors of the scripture repository.

Two years later, one night, Fu Yingcong hanged himself in the woods outside the temple.

Another year passed, and Benyue suddenly went mad, gouging out his own eyes. He was never coherent again, living his days and nights in a state of terror.

However, in the vast Shaolin Temple, these were merely a few trivial incidents.

No one would notice.
