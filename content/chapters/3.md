# Chapter 3: Foes in the Wind and Snow

Kunlun Year 82, winter, the twelfth month.

Ming Buxiang had been at the Hall of True Insight for over a year.

After the Dragon Boat Festival, another incident occurred at Shaolin Temple: a disciple from the Hall of Upright Action hanged himself.

Like the affair with Bu Gui, the matter caused a great stir. The Hall of Upright Action soon closed the case, ruling it a “suspected suicide over love.”

Abbot Juejian of the Hall of Upright Action seemed to scoff at this, remarking with a cold smile, “That it was suicide is beyond doubt, but from whence came this love?”

Those who knew the reason behind it all sighed to themselves.

Another minor event was the replacement of the work detail leader in the Hall of Upright Action. Benyue, the spotted Dog, left Shaolin Temple, taking up temporary residence at a temple in the Buddha Capital while he waited to return for the martial trial next year and receive his Writ of Chivalry.

Work detail disciples performed the most menial labor in Shaolin Temple, so such a thing was naturally not worth mentioning.

Ming Buxiang swept the Repository of Divine Arts, and for months, one day was like the next. His life was exceedingly simple: he chanted sutras at sunrise, swept the grounds in the early morning, and returned to his room in the afternoon. Every two days he would borrow a book, and after the evening meal, he would close his door, rarely venturing out.

Ordinarily, Ming Buxiang should have shared a two-person room, but the circumstances of Liaoxin’s disappearance were unique. Furthermore, Abbot Juejian held him in high regard and feared he would be drawn into the conflict between the orthodox and secular monks, so he had specially left Liaoxin’s side of the room vacant. But it seemed the Abbot had worried for nothing; outwardly, no one ever went to harass Ming Buxiang.

Not even Benyue, who resented him the most, had ever gone to make trouble for Ming Buxiang.

Besides providing three meals a day, Shaolin Temple also issued one set of clothes and one pair of cloth shoes each year, along with four taels of lamp oil per month. The monthly stipend for a work detail disciple was a mere one hundred wen. Additional pay was given for extra tasks, but it was never much. Whenever clothes became damaged, lamp oil ran low, or other daily necessities were needed, they had to be purchased in the Buddha Capital.

Therefore, Ming Buxiang would make a trip to the Buddha Capital about once a month.

The Buddha Capital was about five li from Shaolin Temple, a distance one could walk by following the wide, newly rebuilt imperial road. It was a grand thoroughfare, spacious enough for eight horse-drawn carriages to travel abreast. Shaolin was not only the foremost sect among the Nine Great Families but also a sacred religious site. During major holidays, especially Buddha's Birthday, tens of millions of devotees would make the pilgrimage, their numbers so great they stood shoulder to shoulder. To avoid disrupting the temple’s tranquility, Shaolin arranged for the various worship activities to be held in the Buddha Capital.

Even so, many believers, whether to fulfill a vow or to pray for blessings, would perform three prostrations and nine kowtows on the imperial road in the direction of the distant Great Hall of Heroes. Despite the road’s great width, it was still often congested on Buddha's Birthday.

The prosperity of the Buddha Capital stood in stark contrast to the tranquility of Shaolin Temple. Here, teahouses, taverns, inns, and shops lined the streets. Several thousand Shaolin disciples had started families here, including lay disciples who had received the Writ of Chivalry without being tonsured, In-Hall Laymen who assisted with official duties, and married secular monks. The Shaolin members responsible for governing the Zhengzhou region—whether orthodox monk, secular monk, layman, or disciple—mostly resided in the southeastern corner of the Buddha Capital. This area was also known as the Nameless Temple, the very place Ming Buxiang had lived with Liaoxin in his childhood. Though he had traveled to the Buddha Capital many times, Ming Buxiang had never gone back to see it.

That year, in the twelfth month, several heavy snows fell upon Mount Shaoshi. The sky was a gloomy gray, and the northern wind howled as if brewing an even more violent storm.

Before setting out, Ming Buxiang took a snow cloak from Liaoxin’s wardrobe. He was at an age of rapid growth, and his height had shot up so quickly that the cloak Liaoxin had bought for him no longer fit. He had unstitched its cotton padding to stuff into his quilt and had taken to wearing Liaoxin’s clothes instead. Liaoxin had not been tall, but he was stout, and the padded jacket looked slightly large on Ming Buxiang.

Ming Buxiang lowered his head, sniffed the scent lingering on the clothes, and then pushed open the door. Fine snow still drifted outside. He fetched a bamboo hat and set out into the storm.

The northern wind assaulted his face. The mountain path was deserted; it seemed he was the only person descending the mountain, braving a blizzard that threatened to turn savage at any moment.

The eternal flame before the Buddha statue was about to flicker out; he needed to buy a wick.

He reached the Buddha Capital before long. Even on a snowy day, the main street was still bustling with pedestrians. Ming Buxiang found a shopkeeper he knew, spent two wen on a packet of wicks, and tucked it inside his robes to keep it from the snow.

Ordinarily, he would have started back then, but today, Ming Buxiang took a turn and went to the Ganjiang Ironworks.

The Ganjiang Ironworks had a grand name, but its craftsmanship was not nearly as impressive. It was just an ordinary smithy, one you might even call shoddy. Naturally, that also meant it was cheap.

Ming Buxiang took a turn about the shop, which amounted to no more than a few steps. The establishment was truly tiny; subtracting the space used to display various weapons and the counter for payment, there was only enough room left for two people to squeeze past each other.

The blacksmith of Ganjiang Ironworks was surnamed Yao, his given name Yunda; he was from out of town. He did not live in the Buddha Capital. The price of property there was exorbitant, and just renting this storefront was a struggle, to say nothing of his lackluster business. Seeing a customer enter—a handsome youth in ill-fitting clothes, no less—he hurried forward to greet him.

“Looking for a weapon, sir? A precept blade, longsword, short dagger, a monk’s spade, or a spear?”

Ming Buxiang gently stroked the flat of a precept blade, his expression solemn.

“I read in a book that a blade is ill-suited for thrusting, and a sword is ill-suited for cleaving. Is that so?”

Yao Yunda replied, “That is so.”

He saw how handsome and gentle the youth was and felt that none of the weapons in his shop would look right in his hands. Noticing his young age, he selected a short dagger that could be hidden in a sleeve and said, “Perhaps the young hero would like to try this? It is suitable for self-defense, and when traveling, it’s handy for chopping firewood or other small tasks.”

Ming Buxiang reached out and took it, weighing it in his hand.

“Too short, and too light. It can only cut and pierce; the edge would chip easily.”

Yao Yunda said, “For something long, heavy, and able to smash, you want a monk’s spade. It can chop and thrust. You could fell a tree as thick as a bowl in just two or three strikes.”

Ming Buxiang glanced at the monk’s spades displayed in the shop, shook his head, and said, “Thank you, shopkeeper, I will think on it more.” He then gave a respectful and polite bow, left Ganjiang Ironworks, and entered the Chan Wind Teahouse across the street.

The Chan Wind Teahouse was not the most expensive teahouse in the Buddha Capital, nor was it the finest, but it was the largest. Shaolin Temple was the seat of the Chan school’s orthodoxy, and the number of monks under its jurisdiction far surpassed that of other sects. Though the Mount Heng Sect also revered the Buddha, it was a mix of monks, Daoists, and secular folks, and did not require its disciples to take monastic vows. Thus, among the Nine Great Families, Shaolin still had the largest monastic population.

Monks observed precepts forbidding alcohol and meat, which led to a proliferation of teahouses serving vegetarian refreshments and tea within Shaolin’s domain. The Chan Wind Teahouse was reasonably priced, clean, and elegant. It had no private rooms; its two floors were filled with a full one hundred and fifty tables, so the interior was naturally abuzz with the clamor of voices.

When Ming Buxiang stepped into the teahouse, the two rows of tables directly facing the main entrance were empty.

There were two reasons for this. First, the seats facing the door were drafty. The second reason was that the left side of the main hall was mostly occupied by lay disciples, while the right side was mostly filled with monks.

Ming Buxiang recognized several disciples from the Hall of Upright Action and the Hall of True Insight. The left side was largely the faction of secular monks, while the right was the faction of orthodox monks. As was to be expected, many people here also recognized Ming Buxiang, and his entrance naturally drew their attention.

As if to deliberately attract notice, Ming Buxiang paused at the entrance for a long moment, seemingly hesitant. This caused even more eyes to turn his way.

Left or right, orthodox monk or secular monk?

In the end, Ming Buxiang chose a seat in the middle.

Resentful glares were cast his way, though there were, of course, also nods of approval and sighs of relief. In any case, everyone soon returned to their own affairs and paid him no more mind.

Ming Buxiang ordered a pot of coarse tea and a dish of melon seeds.

He had been to the Chan Wind Teahouse before, back when the disciples of the Hall of True Insight were still on good terms. He and Bu Gui had both come here. This was his first visit since Bu Gui’s death, and he was the only one of their group to return to this old haunt.

He avoided the misshapen seeds that might prove difficult to crack open, selecting only those with flawless shells. He nibbled on them, then laid the empty shells out neatly on the table. Lost in thought, he carefully arranged the shells into a pattern.

It was a crooked shape, like a small ladle, or perhaps a short dagger.

After a moment, Ming Buxiang noticed his actions were drawing attention, so he swept the arranged shells back into the small dish.

Then he noticed someone.

The man was about forty years of age, with a sharp chin and a shock of unkempt hair. Like himself, he sat alone at a table. Stacked before him were seven or eight empty saucers, and he was furtively watching the Ganjiang Ironworks across the street, his gaze fixed upon it.

※ ※ ※

The man’s name was Yin Sen. He had come to Mount Shaoshi not to worship the Buddha, nor to seek martial instruction, but to take revenge.

It had taken him twelve years to finally track down his enemy. That enemy was across the street in the ironworks, running a dishonest business.

And why wouldn’t he? With such self-taught skills, how could he possibly forge a decent weapon?

He turned his head, and his eyes met Ming Buxiang’s.

Ming Buxiang offered a faint, polite smile to diffuse the awkwardness, a smile like the warm sun on melting snow.

Yin Sen started, averted his gaze, then glanced sideways at Ming Buxiang again. Seeing the youth focused on drinking his tea, he decided it must have been a coincidence and returned his attention to the ironworks.

Winter days were short. Before long, the owner of Ganjiang Ironworks packed up, put up the shutters, locked the door, and started up the mountain. Yin Sen quickly paid his bill, grabbed his sword and bamboo hat, and furtively followed.

Yao Yunda walked up the mountain along the imperial road, appearing to head for Shaolin Temple. Soon, however, he made a turn, cut through a forest, and followed a small path up the mountain.

The path was exceedingly treacherous. To the left was a rock face, and to the right, a sheer cliff, with only enough room for two people to walk abreast. A sudden gust of wind nearly tore the hat from Yin Sen’s head. He looked up just as a squall of heavy snow blasted him in the face.

“Damn it, why now!” Yin Sen peered ahead. His enemy was moving faster, clearly anxious to get home and escape the blizzard.

The snowstorm, though anticipated, was of an unexpected ferocity. The gale and heavy snow quickly buried the path and obscured his vision. Yin Sen had to draw closer to keep from losing his quarry. He hurried his pursuit when suddenly his foot found empty air, and he nearly fell. He quickly twisted at the waist, barely managing to right himself. Looking up at the cliff’s edge, he saw that the peak was heavy with snow; if it gave way, the path would be completely blocked.

Walking in the snow was difficult, and the ground was narrow and slick. Had he fallen just now, he would have been dashed to pieces. Seeing his enemy pulling away, Yin Sen gritted his teeth, cast aside the danger, and pressed on, hugging the rock wall.

After another two li or so, he could vaguely make out a small cabin. Yao Yunda quickened his pace and pushed the door open. Light flared within. Yin Sen hid outside, peering through a crack in the window.

The cabin was not large, perhaps two rooms and a main hall, with firewood stacked by the door. Yao Yunda lit a brazier, retrieved a small wine pot from a cabinet, and poured himself a cup to ward off the chill.

‘Where is that bitch?’ Yin Sen thought. ‘There are two rooms in this cabin. Does he have a child?’

He waited for a moment, but the person he hoped to see did not appear. Outside, the blizzard intensified. He began to shiver violently, fearing he would soon freeze solid.

He could delay no longer. He began to contemplate his attack. After a moment’s thought, he walked to the door and knocked.

“Who is it?” a voice called from inside.

“I am a Hall Monk from Shaolin Temple, caught in the storm while on business,” Yin Sen said, lowering his voice. “I hope you can offer me shelter.”

“Coming.” Yao Yunda walked toward the door. Yin Sen tightened his grip on his sword, preparing to strike the moment the door opened.

“May I ask for the Master’s dharma name?” Yao Yunda did not open the door immediately, instead asking with caution. Yin Sen thought for a moment, then blurted out a fabricated name, “This humble monk is named Liaoming.”

“Slide your Writ of Chivalry under the door so I can see it,” Yao Yunda said.

Yin Sen was stunned. He hadn’t expected such caution and was momentarily at a loss for words. Yao Yunda asked again, and Yin Sen replied hastily, “I was only on an errand nearby; I didn’t bring my Writ of Chivalry with me.”

Yao Yunda said, “Walk over to the window and let me see you.”

Helpless, Yin Sen looked toward the window and said, “Alright. It’s dark out here, you’ll have to come close to the window to see clearly.”

Yao Yunda agreed. Seeing that he had moved to the window, Yin Sen rushed forward. The moment their eyes met, he thrust his sword at Yao Yunda through the window.

The strike shattered the window but was slowed by the impact. Yao Yunda threw himself to the side, losing his balance. Fearing a follow-up attack, he rolled twice on the ground, away from the window. Yin Sen kicked through the broken frame and leaped into the room, raising his sword to hack at Yao Yunda while shouting, “You bastard son of a bitch, die!”

Unarmed, Yao Yunda hastily grabbed a stool to block. With a crack, the sword bit into the wood. Yao Yunda gave a hard twist, throwing Yin Sen off balance, and used the opportunity to scramble to his feet and retrieve a weapon.

Yin Sen wrenched his sword free. By the time he turned, Yao Yunda had taken a saber down from the wall. Yin Sen surged forward, thrusting his sword toward his enemy’s back. Yao Yunda quickly raised his saber to parry, and Yin Sen followed up with a heart-piercing kick that landed squarely on Yao Yunda’s chest.

Yao Yunda grunted in pain and swung his saber down, slashing Yin Sen across the leg. Blood gushed forth immediately. Ignoring the pain, Yin Sen executed Wudang’s Soft Cloud Swordplay. It was one of the Wudang Sect’s superior sword arts, emphasizing a fluid and unending succession of strikes. However, Yin Sen’s training was lacking, and his forms were clearly distinct from one another; even if they were clouds, they were scattered and broken.

Yao Yunda met his every move. After blocking several strikes, he unleashed a Wudang technique: “Force Cleaves Mountains and Rivers.” This move prized raw, ferocious power, using substance to shatter illusion. A successful strike could cleave a man in two.

But Yao Yunda’s own power was insufficient. Though he executed the form correctly, Yin Sen dodged it.

With a cry of, “Got you!” from Yin Sen, his sword struck the radius bone in Yao Yunda’s arm, making him howl in agony. Just as Yin Sen moved to press his advantage, a searing pain shot through him from his wounded leg. Yao Yunda seized the opening and kicked out. Yin Sen raised an arm to block but, in his haste, failed to channel his internal energy and was sent rolling across the floor.

Yao Yunda dared not pursue, leaning against a wall and gasping for breath. Yin Sen retreated to the doorway. The two glared at each other, gritting their teeth, their mutual hatred burning in their eyes.

A fierce wind swept in through the broken window, causing the coals in the brazier to glow ever brighter.

They each took stock of their injuries. Yao Yunda had two broken ribs, and the sword wound on his left hand was deep enough to show bone; he would be at a disadvantage from now on. Yin Sen was no better off. The gash on his thigh was bleeding profusely and would certainly impede his movement.

Fearing Yao Yunda might escape, Yin Sen guarded the doorway tightly. They glared at one another, their eyes practically spitting fire. After a long moment, a sudden *snap* came from the brazier as a piece of charcoal cracked. Both men involuntarily glanced toward the sound, and their eyes went wide in unison.

A handsome youth in an ill-fitting snow cloak had entered the room at some unknown point and was now sitting by the brazier, warming himself.

“Who are you?” Yao Yunda studied the youth, finding him familiar. He recalled seeing him in the ironworks earlier and thought, ‘Could he have been scouting for him?’

He barked, “Are you his accomplice?”

“I am a Shaolin disciple, my name is Ming Buxiang,” the youth replied with a gentle smile. “I was out on business and was trapped by the snowstorm.”

He gave the exact same reason as Yin Sen.

“This is none of your business! Get out!” Yao Yunda roared.

“The mountain path was blocked by the snow on my way here. I cannot turn back, and there are no other dwellings nearby, so I can only stay here for now. Please grant me shelter,” Ming Buxiang said, seemingly oblivious to the tense standoff before him. He warmed his hands by the brazier, then leaned in closer, gently stroking his face to warm it as well.

By now, the sun had set, and the cabin was plunged into darkness, lit only by the glow of the brazier. In the firelight, Ming Buxiang appeared even more strikingly handsome.

Yin Sen was startled by his words.

“Nonsense!” he said, only half-believing. “I just came down that path, it was fine!”

“It’s true,” Ming Buxiang said. “I was following behind you. The path is truly buried in snow. Go and see for yourself if you don’t believe me.”

Yin Sen’s expression instantly darkened. It had been a small path to begin with, already obscured by days of heavy snow. With tonight’s blizzard, it wouldn’t be surprising if it were completely impassable. But if the only route to the outside world was truly cut off, how would he leave after taking his revenge? That was a serious problem.

“Why were you following me?” Yin Sen asked, recognizing him now. “I saw you in the Chan Wind Teahouse!”

“Indeed.” Ming Buxiang looked at Yin Sen. “In the teahouse, you had seven empty snack dishes on your table, which told me you had been there for a very long time. Drinking tea alone while staring at the ironworks owner across the street… it was too suspicious.” Ming Buxiang turned his gaze back to the brazier. “I grew curious, so I followed. I didn’t expect that halfway here I would hear a great crack, and when I turned to look, the path was gone, buried in snow. Unable to go back, I had no choice but to continue on.”

“You’re a Shaolin disciple, you must know martial arts?” Yao Yunda said. “I know many of my martial brothers. Which hall are you from?”

“The Hall of Upright Action,” Ming Buxiang said, then added after a thought, “Or perhaps I should be considered a member of the Hall of True Insight.”

“I know Abbot Jueming! Help me kill this man, and I will report it to the Abbot and see that you are credited with a great merit!” Yao Yunda said quickly.

“Bullshit! What great personage would a scrap-metal smith like you know?” Yin Sen retorted. “I have five taels of silver on me. Help me kill him, and it’s all yours!”

“I have more silver than he does! Help me kill him, and I will give you ten taels!”

“Fuck, where would a poor bastard like you get ten taels of silver? Ten taels of dog shit, more like!”

The two of them fell back into a volley of curses.

Ming Buxiang said, “I came here to shelter from the storm. I never intended to kill anyone.” He looked at the fire and asked, “Aren’t you two cold?”

The blizzard raged outside, and with the window broken, a torrent of cold wind and snow poured into the cabin. Both Yin Sen and Yao Yunda began to feel the chill, and they knew it would only grow colder as the night deepened.

Yin Sen, hidden behind the door, was somewhat sheltered, but Yao Yunda stood directly in the path of the window, bearing the full brunt of the wind and snow. It was unbearable. While remaining on guard, he shifted his position, moving to a cabinet and nudging it slightly to block some of the wind.

Yin Sen thought, ‘It would be fine if you just froze to death!’

Yao Yunda thought, ‘This can’t go on. He’s guarding the door, trapping me here. Am I to be left for dead?’ He glanced involuntarily toward the window.

Yin Sen caught his intention and grew anxious. If Yao Yunda escaped through the window, his injured leg would make it impossible to give chase. He had spent twelve years searching for him; how could he let him get away now? Just as he was wracking his brain for a solution, Ming Buxiang spoke again.

“It’s a good thing this window of yours is broken, otherwise I’m not sure how I would have gotten in. I would have truly frozen to death spending the night outside.”

Yao Yunda’s heart skipped a beat.

‘This youth claims the path is blocked,’ he thought, ‘but who knows if that’s true. If it is, and I escape through the window, all he has to do is guard it and lock the door. I won’t be able to get back in. In this freezing weather, wouldn’t I freeze to death out there?’

But the cold was becoming unbearable. He couldn’t help but say, “Little brother, can you think of a way to block the window?”

A moment ago, he had been planning to escape through that window; now he wanted it covered.

Yin Sen interjected, “Don’t listen to him!”

“You each have a different opinion. I don’t know who to listen to,” Ming Buxiang said. “Come to an agreement and then let me know.”

“I am the owner of this house, so of course you’ll listen to me!” Yao Yunda said. “Hurry and cover the window!”

Ming Buxiang looked at Yin Sen. Yin Sen laughed aloud. “Ignore him! He’ll freeze to death soon enough!”

The wind and snow grew fiercer. Snow drifted into the cabin, soaking the floor, and soon the temperature inside plummeted further. Yao Yunda was shaking uncontrollably from the cold, and Yin Sen was finding it increasingly difficult to bear. Only Ming Buxiang, warming himself by the fire, seemed completely unconcerned.

Yao Yunda reasoned that if this continued, he would be the first to freeze. He suddenly let out a great cry and charged Yin Sen with his saber. Yin Sen swung his sword to counter. Knowing that Yin Sen’s mobility was limited, Yao Yunda fought evasively, circling him. Yin Sen simply retreated into a corner and maintained a tight defense. Unable to find an opening, Yao Yunda was forced to withdraw.

The brief exchange made both their wounds ache with renewed intensity. They both now understood that a true fight to the death would most likely end in their mutual destruction. An idea came to Yao Yunda. He walked over to Ming Buxiang with a smile on his face and actually squatted down to warm himself by the fire. Ming Buxiang did not stop him.

Yin Sen never imagined Yao Yunda would go to the brazier for warmth. Just as he raised his sword to approach, Yao Yunda instantly raised his saber in a defensive posture, clearly anticipating that any move would lead to another mutually destructive clash. Yin Sen considered that if he retreated to his corner, he would likely be the first to freeze to death that night. As he hesitated, wondering whether to risk it all, Ming Buxiang suddenly spoke. “This firewood won’t last long.”

His words were a reminder to Yin Sen, who immediately retreated to the corner where the firewood was stacked, placing it under his guard.

Now the situation was reversed. If Yao Yunda wanted more firewood, he would have to go through Yin Sen. Yin Sen piled the wood up and took out his flint and steel, but to his dismay, the fierce weather and his own carelessness had left his tinder and stone damp. He tried several times, but they would not spark.

Yao Yunda roared with laughter. “This is fate! We are meant to freeze to death together! If that’s the case, we might as well end it now!” He raised his saber, preparing to charge again.

‘Better to die in a blaze of glory than to freeze to death!’ Yin Sen thought. Just as he was about to meet the attack, Ming Buxiang suddenly spoke up. “Not necessarily. Even if you both freeze, one of you will surely go first.”

This sentence reminded them both.

Yin Sen thought, ‘My back is to the window, so I’m not taking the full force of the wind like they are. He’s already been freezing for so long. Once my tinder dries, I can start a fire, and he’ll be the one to freeze to death.’

But Yao Yunda thought, ‘I’m warming myself here, regaining my strength, while he freezes. In this damp weather, his tinder and flint may not dry by morning. He will definitely be the first to die.’

Suddenly, another thought occurred to Yao Yunda. He turned to Ming Buxiang.

“Little brother, when the fire goes out, you’ll freeze to death too. Why not join me? We kill this bastard, and when the blizzard passes, I’ll escort you back to Shaolin Temple.”

Ming Buxiang said, “Your feud has nothing to do with me. I am only here to shelter from the storm. To help one of you kill the other is something I absolutely cannot do.”

“I am the owner of this house. If you wish to shelter here, you must help me kill him. Otherwise, I will throw you out.”

Ming Buxiang said lightly, “If you try to drive me out, I will die if I leave this cabin. I will certainly resist. And when I resist, that man will come to my aid.”

Yao Yunda heard this and knew it was true. This youth clearly had some martial skill, and he himself was injured. If he pushed him too far, the youth might very well join forces with Yin Sen, and he would stand no chance.

“Without firewood, you will freeze to death too,” he said instead.

“Perhaps. But you are both injured and have been exposed to the cold wind for half the day. You will have a much harder time of it than I. Once either of you is dead, things will become much simpler for me.”

Yao Yunda said angrily, “And you call yourself a Shaolin disciple! Have you not a shred of compassion? You would watch us die and do nothing!”

Ming Buxiang shook his head. “This is your own personal feud. I am merely a passerby. It would be wrong for me to help either side.”

The fire in the brazier was dwindling, and the room grew colder. Yao Yunda and Yin Sen shivered uncontrollably, knowing they might well freeze to death. And yet, the firewood was right there. To die like this was sheer folly.

Ming Buxiang said, “I’m getting a little cold. What do you say, should we cover the window?”

Yao Yunda snarled, “I told you to cover it earlier, and you refused!”

“He didn’t agree then,” Ming Buxiang said, looking at Yin Sen. “There are three people in this room. Without unanimous agreement, I cannot cover the window.”

Yin Sen dared not be stubborn now. He quickly agreed. Ming Buxiang pushed the cabinet in front of the window, covering it.

With the window blocked, the wind and snow immediately ceased to pour in. Only a few faint drafts slipped through the cracks. Both men instantly felt much warmer. The room was now pitch-black, save for the faint glow of the embers. Ming Buxiang found and lit two candles. The light was weak, but it was better than nothing.

Yin Sen and Yao Yunda removed their damp outer robes. They had fought, lost blood, and suffered from the cold; now hunger began to set in. Yao Yunda got up and opened a cabinet filled with dry rations like steamed buns and flatbread. He took a piece of flatbread and began to eat.

Ming Buxiang also rose, walked to Yao Yunda, and said, “I want half.”

“Why should I give you any?” He looked toward Yin Sen. “If you’re willing to help me, giving you half would be no problem.”

Ming Buxiang shook his head. “I help no one. I am only seeking a place to shelter from the elements. I will not do anything that does not have the unanimous consent of everyone in this room.” He turned to look at Yin Sen. “Do you think he should give me half?”

Yin Sen let out a great laugh. “It would be best if you took all of it!”

Ming Buxiang said, “I only want half.” He looked back at Yao Yunda. “Now you are the only one who objects.”

Yao Yunda understood his implication. If he did not give him half, the youth would likely join Yin Sen against him. He had no choice but to hand over half of his rations.

Ming Buxiang took his share of the food and walked over to Yin Sen, who immediately grew wary. Ming Buxiang said, “I also want half of this firewood.”

Yin Sen saw Yao Yunda smirking and gritted his teeth. “You must give me a light, or I won’t give you so much as a splinter, even if I die.”

Ming Buxiang lit a candle and handed it to Yin Sen, then took half the firewood.

Ming Buxiang moved the brazier to his corner, piled the wood on the embers, and soon had the fire roaring again. He sat before it, warming himself. When Yao Yunda tried to approach, Ming Buxiang said, “This is my firewood. He gave it to me. If you want some, you’ll have to get it from him.”

Rage swelled in Yao Yunda’s heart. He was about to make a move, but the thought of Yin Sen watching his back like a hawk stopped him.

“What will it take for you to share some?” he asked.

“Trade food for it,” Ming Buxiang said. “Bring me half your food, and I will give you half my firewood.”

The blizzard had not let up. Yao Yunda was wet and cold. If he continued like this, he would likely be dead by morning. He had no choice but to trade another half of his food for firewood. Seeing that Yao Yunda now had both food and firewood, Yin Sen quickly began to negotiate with Ming Buxiang, trading half of his own firewood for some food.

Yao Yunda grabbed the firewood and glared at Yin Sen, who glared right back at him; the two men each started their own fire. Almost simultaneously, two blazes rose within the house. After freezing for half a day, the sudden warmth felt like a rebirth, and both men could not help but let out a long sigh of relief.

However, the food and firewood they had were only a little more than twenty percent of the original amount.

With three fires now in the house, it naturally grew warm. Ming Buxiang dried his snow-white robes and draped them over his shoulders, then warmed a flatbread over the fire to eat.

Afterwards, he sat cross-legged on the floor, clasped his hands together, bowed his head with his eyes closed, and began to chant softly, starting his evening prayers. Both Yao Yunda and Yin Sen were injured, had lost blood, and had been freezing for half a day; they were now hungry, cold, and exhausted. Their faces were pale and their spirits were low, yet they still forced themselves to follow Ming Buxiang’s example and roast flatbreads to eat.

Outside, the wind howled incessantly, squeezing through the cracks in the walls with a whimpering wail like a ghostly cry. The two enemies faced each other across the flickering firelight, gnashing their teeth, both wishing they could tear the other apart like the flatbread in their mouths, yet they were helpless to do anything.

Another hour passed, and a deep weariness settled over both men. They desperately wanted to rest, but each feared the other would strike while they slept, so they had no choice but to keep forcing themselves to stay awake.

Yin Sen suddenly remembered something and asked, “Why haven’t I seen Huigu?”

Yao Yunda cursed, “Shut your mouth! What right do you have to say her name!”

Yin Sen sneered, “She’s my wife. Why can’t I say her name?”

Yao Yunda retorted, “If she had even half an ounce of affection for you as a husband, why would she have left with me?”

A sudden realization dawned on Yin Sen, and he asked, “She’s dead?”

Yao Yunda replied, “You abused her. Her health was never good.”

“It seems neither of you wants to sleep,” Ming Buxiang said suddenly. “What deep-seated hatred drives you both to insist on the other’s death?”

“What’s it to you?” Yin Sen snapped. He was naturally resentful that Ming Buxiang had taken nearly half their food and firewood and then refused to help.

“You both want my help, but I don’t know who to help.” The handsome youth’s voice flickered like the wavering fire, elusive and hard to grasp. “Explain yourselves clearly, so that I may distinguish the good man from the bad.”

Hearing this, the two men rushed to speak at once, shouting and cursing at each other, creating an immediate stalemate. Ming Buxiang shook his head.

“This is no way to get a clear story.” He extended a long, slender, pale forefinger and pointed it at Yin Sen. “You first.”

Yao Yunda said angrily, “Why should he go first?”

Suddenly, a shadow flickered. Yao Yunda felt a stinging slap across his face, and when he looked again, Ming Buxiang was already sitting back down.

The two men were startled; they had assumed the boy was just an ordinary Shaolin disciple with some martial arts training, never imagining he was this skilled.

They heard Ming Buxiang say, “Say one more word, and I’ll help him instead of you.”

Yin Sen quickly said, “Great hero, with your incredible skill, why not just get rid of him now? We’d have more firewood and grain.” The words had barely left his mouth when he, too, felt a slap across his face.

Ming Buxiang adjusted his snow-white robe and said flatly, “If you don’t start talking, I’ll let him go first.”

Both men were furious, yet they were wary of Ming Buxiang’s superior martial skill and feared he would team up with their rival, so they dared not act out. Eager for Ming Buxiang’s help, Yin Sen began to recount his past.

“I am from Hubei, a disciple of the Clear Cloud Temple, an offshoot of Wudang. My wife and I knew each other since we were children, and we were once very much in love…”

Yao Yunda started to interrupt, but remembering Ming Buxiang’s earlier reprimand, he forced himself to hold his tongue.

Yin Sen continued, “This Yao Yunda is an outsider. Who knows if he got into trouble at Mount Hua, but he ran hundreds of miles to become an apprentice. He is my junior martial brother. When he first joined, our master told me to take good care of him, and I treated him with all my heart, guiding him in all matters. When he struggled with his training, I patiently taught him. After receiving our Writs of Chivalry, we both worked as bodyguards for the Xiangyang Gang. I truly thought of him as a brother, but who knew this son of a bitch would seduce my wife while I was away working on the boats! He abducted her, and then caused her death! How can I not avenge the theft of my wife? I’ve been searching for him for twelve years! Finally, the heavens showed mercy. A brother I worked with on the boats happened to be visiting Shaolin to pay respects and saw this ungrateful beast in the Buddha Capital. He told me, and that’s how I finally found this animal!”

“Twelve years?” Ming Buxiang repeated, then asked, “You never remarried?”

“I have only one wife! Our bond was deep, so of course I had to get her back!” Yin Sen said angrily. “Even in death, her memorial tablet must be placed in the Yin family home! Young hero, I treated him like a brother, and he made me a cuckold. Tell me, does a man like that not deserve to die?”

“Are you done with your fucking bullshit yet?” Yao Yunda cursed. “If you’re done, then it’s my turn! Fuck you and your goddamn nonsense!”

He was clearly enraged, spitting out an endless stream of profanities. Ming Buxiang turned to look at him and said, “Your turn.”

Yao Yunda said, “I was originally from Taiyuan. Taiyuan is near the ‘Lone Grave Lands,’ a rather restless area where it’s not easy to make a living. Although I learned some basic fighting from the monks at a nearby temple as a child, I never formally became a disciple. At fifteen, I went to Wudang to learn martial arts and entered the tutelage of Master Fulu, which gave me a skill to rely on. I graduated at twenty-five, received my Writ of Chivalry, and joined the Xiangyang Gang…”

“I’m not interested in your life story,” Ming Buxiang said. “Just get to the important parts.”

Cut off by the youth, Yao Yunda’s face flushed red, and he continued, “This animal received his Writ of Chivalry two years later. His skills were lacking, and it was only because I begged and pleaded that he was allowed on the ships. I never expected him to be such a coward, beating his wife every few days. I couldn’t bear to watch it. Huigu… she cried to me about it. I already liked her in secret, so how could I stand to see her suffer? So, while this coward was away on a long trip, I took her with me and we hid here at Shaolin. Poor her, she only had a few good years before…”

Hearing Yao Yunda mention his wife’s name, Yin Sen exploded with more curses, and the two began to argue again, dredging up all sorts of ugly stories about each other. Ming Buxiang shook his head.

“From what I hear, neither of you is a good person, and I can’t tell who is worse.” After saying this, he ignored them both, wrapped himself in his robes, and went to sleep.

When dawn arrived, Ming Buxiang arose to find Yao Yunda and Yin Sen huddled in opposite corners of the room, glaring at each other. Wary of one another, neither had dared to fall asleep, and they had remained in a standoff all night.

This was Ming Buxiang’s first night spent outside the Shaolin Temple, and as was his custom, he had to perform his morning prayers. Seeing no Buddhist statues in Yao Yunda’s home, he faced the west and bowed, reciting his sutras. Afterwards, he pushed aside a wooden cabinet and saw that the wind and snow outside had lessened. He gathered some snow in a pot, melted it into water, and washed himself briefly.

After finishing his routine, he put on his snow-white robes and said to the two men, “I’m going to check the path.” He then pointed to the food and firewood. “This is mine. If you touch any of it, I will take it back.” With that, he stood up and leaped out through the window.

Yin Sen and Yao Yunda still dared not sleep and continued to glare at each other. Yin Sen, recalling last night’s conversation, asked, “How did she die?”

Yao Yunda replied, “A difficult childbirth. Neither the mother nor the child could be saved.”

Yin Sen said hatefully, “You killed her!”

Yao Yunda spat. “Say that again and I’ll fight you to the death!”

Yin Sen retorted, “You’re asking for it!”

The two men grabbed their weapons and began to fight again, but after a day of exhaustion and a sleepless night, where would they find the strength? They exchanged a few rounds, but it was a pointless waste of energy, and they each retreated to their own space, panting heavily.

After a long wait, Ming Buxiang finally jumped back into the house and asked, “Do people come by here often?”

Yao Yunda shook his head. “Sometimes ten days or half a month can pass without anyone coming by.”

Ming Buxiang asked, “Why live in such a remote place?”

Yao Yunda glanced at Yin Sen and said coldly, “To hide from an enemy.”

“The road is completely blocked. If no one passes by, I’m afraid it will be several days before we can leave. Did you never consider you might get trapped here?”

Yao Yunda replied, “This food and firewood is enough to last one person for half a month.”

“That’s for one person. There are three of us here.”

He sat on the ground, seemingly pondering a difficult problem, then looked at the two men and asked, “Aren’t you going to settle this once and for all?”

The implication was obvious: if one of them died, the remaining firewood and food could be divided. Yao Yunda and Yin Sen looked at each other, both feeling they had no confidence in winning a decisive battle at that moment.

Ming Buxiang said, “You’ve been exhausted all night; you must be desperate to sleep. How about this: three flatbreads and two sticks of firewood for my protection while you sleep.”

Yao Yunda said angrily, “Why don’t you just kill us? Then it would all be yours!”

“My master says I must not lightly break the precept against killing. You haven’t tried to take my life, so why should I kill you? Protecting you while you sleep is a good deed; it can’t be compared to murder.”

Yin Sen quickly said, “I’ll pay! I’ll pay!” He immediately portioned out his food and firewood for Ming Buxiang.

Yao Yunda thought to himself, ‘After he’s well-rested, he’ll be full of energy. How could I possibly fight him then?’ He had no choice but to also give his share of food and firewood to Ming Buxiang.

The two men lay down in their clothes. At first, they were still uneasy, but after a while, they could no longer resist the heavy wave of sleepiness and fell into a deep slumber.

They slept straight through until the afternoon. Yin Sen was the first to wake up. He quickly sat up, saw that Yao Yunda was still sound asleep, and was struck by a malicious idea. He reached for his sword.

“You cannot harm him,” said Ming Buxiang, who had sensed his intention. “I promised to let you both sleep in peace.”

Yin Sen said, “You heard our stories last night. Surely you can distinguish right from wrong? I treated him like a brother, and he stole my wife. Is he not the one in the wrong?”

“Why did you beat your wife?” Ming Buxiang asked. “You haven’t remarried in twelve years, and you speak constantly of the hatred of having your wife stolen, yet you never seem to blame her. If you truly loved her, why would you hit her?”

“She was clumsy and made me angry, and I have a bad temper…”

“Yao Yunda joined the sect after you, yet he received his Writ of Chivalry two years before you did, and he was more valued than you at the Xiangyang Gang,” Ming Buxiang said. “You were jealous of him.”

Yin Sen was stunned. Just as he was about to argue, Ming Buxiang shook his head and continued, “You saw your junior brother, who joined after you, learn faster than you and get his Writ of Chivalry sooner. Meanwhile, you struggled with your own training. You took your frustration out on your wife, then regretted it afterward, shifting the blame to others without any self-reflection, wanting only to blame him…”

“Fuck you!” Yao Yunda suddenly shot up, his eyes wide open. It turned out he had been awake for some time, only pretending to sleep so he could counterattack if Yin Sen tried anything. Now, hearing Ming Buxiang lay out the past, he couldn't stop himself from leaping up in a rage.

“If I hadn’t taken Huigu away, you would have bullied her to death sooner or later!” He then turned to Ming Buxiang. “Tell me, doesn’t he deserve to die?”

Yin Sen, his innermost thoughts exposed by Ming Buxiang, was both furious and chagrined. Hearing Yao Yunda’s words, he was momentarily at a loss for a rebuttal.

“Did you ever try to reason with him?” Ming Buxiang asked Yao Yunda.

Yao Yunda was caught completely off guard by the question. Even Yin Sen looked confused.

“You said you had liked his wife for a long time,” Ming Buxiang continued. “The fact that she ran away with you shows that you were in frequent contact. You must have known that he often beat her. Did you ever say a single word to dissuade him?”

“Or did you perhaps hope he would hit her more fiercely, making it easier for you to take advantage of the situation?”

This question was like a battering ram, crashing through a section of the city wall without warning. Yao Yunda was completely unprepared and could only stare, dumbfounded, muttering, “I… I didn't…”

“Yao Yunda!” Yin Sen roared.

Yao Yunda, sword in hand, shouted, “So what if I did think that way? In the end, you were the one who was wrong first!” The memory of his wife’s tragic death rekindled his hatred.

“Who do you think Huigu would want dead?” Ming Buxiang suddenly asked.

Both men pointed at the other simultaneously and shouted, “Him, of course!”

They were highly agitated, glaring at each other, both convinced the other was responsible for their wife’s death. They raised their weapons and charged. In his fury, Yin Sen forgot about his leg injury. A sharp pain shot through the wound, and he cried out, “Agh!” falling to one knee.

Yao Yunda saw his golden opportunity and raised his sword to strike. Having stumbled on the battlefield, Yin Sen thought his death was certain. A sourness filled his heart, and he thrust his saber forward, determined to take his enemy down with him.

For some reason, Yao Yunda failed to seize this perfect chance. His sword was raised but never came down, and Yin Sen’s saber strike hit nothing but air. Seeing the ferocity of the saber thrust, Yao Yunda realized that if he had pressed his attack, they would have both perished. A cold sweat broke out on his brow, and he hurriedly swung his sword to parry, retreating away.

The three people in the room fell still. Only the wind and snow crept in through the cracks in the door and windows to peer inside. The fire still burned, occasionally letting out a crackling pop.

Yao Yunda retreated to his original spot and sat down, as if all the fight had gone out of him. Yin Sen also shrank back into his corner. Seeing that they had no intention of fighting further, Ming Buxiang asked, “Are you done fighting?”

The two men remained silent, each lost in their own thoughts. They stayed that way until the sun set and darkness fell. After reciting his evening prayers, Ming Buxiang lay down in his clothes and said, “Let me know when you want to sleep.”

His words carried another meaning. The two men were now wary of each other, and neither would dare to sleep alone. They would certainly have to trade their grain and firewood for his protection. At this rate, the food and firewood that was supposed to last for more than half a month would not even last five days, and each time they slept, they would lose more. In just two or three days, both would be completely out of supplies.

‘This little bandit!’ Yin Sen cursed inwardly. He looked at Yao Yunda, who had clearly realized the same problem. For a moment, he felt helpless. They had no choice but to hand over their firewood and food again. They lay down on the floor, but sleep did not come easily that night.

The next day, Ming Buxiang went out to check the path as usual, leaving the other two behind. Yao Yunda saw Yin Sen constantly rubbing his arm and sneered, “Your arm is fractured, and the wound on your thigh is inflamed. It must be quite painful, right?”

Yin Sen retorted mockingly, “If that sword wound on your wrist isn’t treated soon, you’ll be crippled even if it heals.”

“You’ll be a cripple for the rest of your life with that lame leg,” Yao Yunda jibed. “You were always slow anyway, yet you were foolish enough to practice Wudang’s Soft Cloud Swordplay.”

Yin Sen said angrily, “I’ll practice it if I want to! I refuse to believe I can’t master it!”

Yao Yunda laughed out loud. “Diligence makes up for lack of skill—that saying has ruined your entire life. You fool, you don’t have the talent for it. You’ll never be able to learn it!”

This insult struck a nerve in Yin Sen. He was about to lash out, but before the words could leave his mouth, his anger suddenly deflated. He sighed and said, “My whole life really has been ruined by those words: diligence makes up for lack of skill. If I had recognized my own nature sooner, how could I have taken out my frustrations about my poor training on her, forcing her to run away with you?”

Seeing his sudden lament, Yao Yunda was reminded of the past. He fell silent for a long moment before sighing, “I always liked her. If you had treated her well, I would have had nothing to say. It’s better for one person to suffer than for three people to be in misery.”

Yin Sen sneered, “Did you ever think of me when you ran away with her? And you even had a child! Was your conscience clear when you were fucking her?”

Yao Yunda sighed, “I do feel guilty. When she died in childbirth because her body was weak, and even the child couldn’t be saved, I actually thought… I thought… this is my retribution…”

The two men, who had once been close friends, were now sworn enemies, and a wave of complex emotions washed over them.

Yin Sen said, “Yesterday when I fell, why didn’t you strike the killing blow?”

Yao Yunda shook his head. “That kid asked who Huigu would most want to die. I think if she knows in the underworld, she might hate me even more than she hates you…”

Yin Sen sighed. “Fine. At this point, what else is there to say? Right now, we both have less than two days of supplies left. We can survive a few days without food, but without firewood, we won’t last a single night.”

Yao Yunda said, “Why don’t we settle this now and put an end to our grudge.”

Yin Sen nodded. “Alright!”

The two immediately began to fight, but now their killing intent was gone. After a few exchanges, their moves were mostly defensive, and any occasional killing strikes were half-hearted.

Yao Yunda withdrew his move and retreated, saying, “No more, no more. It’s a waste of energy. Where did your bloodlust go?”

Yin Sen replied, “Right now, I just want to live, and I hope I never see you again in this life.” After a moment, he added, “I’m just afraid we’re both going to die.”

Yao Yunda said, “If we share our firewood, we can last a few more days. Let’s negotiate with that young man and see if he can return some food to us.”

Yin Sen hesitated. “That boy is strange. I’m afraid he wants to keep all the food and firewood for himself.”

Yao Yunda had no confidence in Ming Buxiang either. Just as he was about to speak, the door was pushed open. A blast of wind and snow rushed in, forcing them to shut their eyes. It was Ming Buxiang, returned.

Seeing that the hostility between the two had vanished, Ming Buxiang asked, “You’re not fighting anymore?”

Yao Yunda nodded, “Not for now. Young Hero Ming, let’s make a deal. It’s too wasteful to have three separate fires. Why don’t we share one to conserve firewood and find a way to survive?”

Ming Buxiang poured out some lamp oil and started his own fire without a word. “This is my firewood. If you two want to share, you can share your own.”

Yao Yunda said angrily, “It’s the same fire! It won’t cost you anything extra, so why be so stingy? This is my house!”

Ming Buxiang looked up at Yao Yunda. Being watched by him, Yao Yunda felt a deep sense of unease, but he summoned his courage and said, “Am I wrong?”

“That’s impossible,” Ming Buxiang said, shaking his head. “The road is blocked, and this place is deserted. Even if you save the firewood, there isn’t enough food. I am a vegetarian and I don’t kill people. At most, only one of you can live.”

“What do you mean?” Yin Sen heard the strangeness in his words. A thought began to form, and an icy chill ran through his body. He stammered, “You… you mean… mean…”

“From the very beginning, there was no way for all three of us to survive,” Ming Buxiang said. “I don’t kill people, and I don’t eat meat. But you can.”

Yin Sen and Yao Yunda cried out in unison. Yao Yunda exclaimed, “You want us to kill each other and then eat human flesh?!”

“To eat the other’s flesh and sleep on their hide—didn’t you want to consume each other from the very beginning?”

The two men gasped. They knew that Ming Buxiang was serious.

Silence returned to the small cabin as a new kind of struggle began. Snatching the food back from Ming Buxiang was impossible, but to kill the other and eat his flesh to survive the winter… that was…

‘But if I don’t harm him, will he harm me?’ Yin Sen thought. Although they had cleared the air earlier that day, he now hesitated once more. Could more than a decade of accumulated hatred truly be wiped away just like that?

As night fell, Ming Buxiang repeated his offer: “Three flatbreads and two sticks of firewood for my protection while you sleep.” Yin Sen and Yao Yunda looked at each other, hesitated for a long moment, but ultimately paid the price.

Yin Sen slept very restlessly. Why had Yao Yunda paid for protection if not because he didn't trust him? And seeing that he himself had also paid, didn't that show his own distrust? If there wasn't even trust, how could they talk of resolving their hatred?

After midnight, he heard a faint sound. He squinted and saw that Ming Buxiang was already asleep, leaning against the wall.

‘This kid is really untrustworthy,’ Yin Sen thought, when a new idea struck him. ‘Isn’t this the perfect opportunity to make a move?’

His heart pounded in his chest. The man he had been determined to kill just that morning, for some reason, he now felt hesitant and uneasy about actually doing it. How could twelve years of hatred have vanished in a single afternoon?

He hesitated for a long time but ultimately couldn't bring himself to do it. After a while, a shadow passed before the firelight. Yao Yunda stood up, knife in hand, and began to slowly and stealthily approach.

‘That dog! Is he planning to kill me?’ A rage flared in Yin Sen’s heart, and he suddenly felt that his earlier hesitation had been utterly foolish. This was the man who had stolen his wife! He had offered his sincerity, only to have it thrown in the face of a wolf!

However, contrary to his expectations, he saw Yao Yunda moving with extreme caution, heading not toward him, but toward Ming Buxiang. Yin Sen’s heart skipped a beat. Could Yao Yunda possibly intend to kill Ming Buxiang? But even though the boy was young, his martial arts were incredibly high. How could he… how could he be so foolish?

Sure enough, Yao Yunda reached Ming Buxiang’s side, hesitated for a moment, then clenched his jaw and raised his steel knife. Ming Buxiang’s eyes snapped open. He rolled over, evading the killing blow in the nick of time, then executed a perfect kip-up, kicking out with both feet simultaneously and sending Yao Yunda flying.

With all the commotion, Yin Sen could no longer feign sleep and quickly got up. Yao Yunda charged at Ming Buxiang with his knife, attacking like a crazed tiger, strike after relentless strike. But Ming Buxiang dodged left and right, as light and ethereal as a phantom. No, in the faint light of the dark night, he *was* a phantom—visible but untouchable, almost without substance, like a specter from a trick of the light. Yin Sen was horrified; the youth’s martial skill was several times greater than he had imagined!

All he had to do now was join forces with Ming Buxiang, and they could finish Yao Yunda in a few strikes. He might not even have to do anything himself; he could just wait for Ming Buxiang to handle it. But this boy had a vicious mind, trying to force them to eat human flesh. His claim of not killing people was probably just a game to toy with them. Moreover, even if he did help, there was no way they could defeat this boy. How could Yao Yunda be so stupid as to walk right into his own death?

Meanwhile, Yao Yunda was wildly slashing and hacking, exhausting himself without even touching the corner of his opponent's robe. Ming Buxiang suddenly kicked out, striking Yao Yunda hard in the chest. He then shot out his left hand, gripping Yao Yunda’s wrist, while his right fist slammed into his abdomen. Yao Yunda’s ribs were already broken, and the pain nearly made him pass out. The punch to his lower abdomen sent him into a spasm, and he couldn't help but double over.

Yin Sen felt a wave of dizziness. Seeing his nemesis about to die, he suddenly let out a great shout and lunged from behind, thrusting his sword at Ming Buxiang. Ming Buxiang turned sideways and chopped at his wrist with the side of his hand. The longsword fell to the ground. Blood rushed to Yin Sen’s head, and he threw his arms around Ming Buxiang, roaring, “Kill him now!”

He used all his strength, and for a moment, Ming Buxiang couldn't break free.

Yao Yunda struggled to his feet. Seeing the two entangled, he had no clear shot and shouted, “Get out of the way!”

Yin Sen yelled back, “Don’t worry about me! Better one of us dies than both!”

He understood that the reason Yao Yunda had risked attacking Ming Buxiang was precisely because he didn't want to kill him. Seeing him risk his life to help, Yao Yunda felt even more reluctant to strike, unsure of where to land the blow. These two, who had been mortal enemies just the day before, were now moved by their old camaraderie.

In that moment of hesitation, Ming Buxiang suddenly stopped struggling. Yin Sen was surprised, but then he felt Ming Buxiang’s body twist, and he slipped out of his embrace as easily as an eel. Only then did Yin Sen realize that if Ming Buxiang had wanted to break free, it would have been effortless. If Yao Yunda had actually struck with his knife, he would have likely only killed Yin Sen himself.

Yao Yunda was also dumbfounded, utterly astonished.

Ming Buxiang asked, “So you really don’t want to kill each other anymore?”

The two men didn’t know how to answer, both staring blankly.

Ming Buxiang looked at Yin Sen. Yin Sen said, “I won’t kill him.”

Ming Buxiang nodded. “The path down the mountain is not damaged. After the snowstorm passes, you can leave.”

Yao Yunda asked, “What do you mean?”

Ming Buxiang said, “It means nothing. This is good.” He then pushed open the door of the house. A fierce wind carrying heavy snow swirled inside, forcing Yao Yunda and Yin Sen to squint.

“I’m going back to the temple.” Through the howling wind, they vaguely heard Ming Buxiang say these words. Then the door closed, and the exceptionally handsome youth disappeared into the wind and snow.

Yao Yunda and Yin Sen both let out a sigh of relief at the same time. They had both thought they would surely die that day, but now they had escaped death. Thinking back on all their past foolish actions, feelings of shame and regret washed over them. It felt as if a lifetime had passed, and they couldn’t help but look at each other and smile.

At that moment, the same thought was in both their minds: Where did this mysterious youth come from? Could he truly be a Bodhisattva who had descended to enlighten them?

※ ※ ※

Ming Buxiang was missing for several days, and the martial brothers of the Hall of True Insight all knew, but the snowstorm was too severe for them to go out and search. Only Juejian was extremely anxious, ordering all the Hall Monks of the Hall of Upright Action to look for Ming Buxiang.

When Ming Buxiang returned, he only said that he had gotten lost in the snowy night and had taken shelter for a few days, waiting for the storm to subside before coming back.

A few days later, Yao Yunda came to visit the Shaolin Temple, requesting an audience with a Hall Monk from the Hall of True Insight to report Ming Buxiang’s 'righteous act.'

“If not for his selfless risk, my brother and I would have long since killed each other,” Yao Yunda said through tears. “He is truly a living Bodhisattva reincarnated. By pushing us brothers in that cabin, he gave us the chance to resolve our differences and return to the righteous path.”

The Hall Monk reported the matter to his superiors, and Abbot Jueming found it deeply peculiar.

This Abbot Jueming had a nickname: “Not a Single Leaf Clings.”

It was taken from the saying, “To pass through a field of ten thousand flowers, yet not a single leaf clings to the body.”

This wasn't to say he was unstained by the filth of the world or that his character was transcendent; rather, it meant he always remained detached from matters that didn't concern him, viewing everything with a light and indifferent attitude, dismissing things with a few Buddhist verses. No matter how busy or chaotic things became, he could always “pass through a field of ten thousand flowers, yet not a single leaf clings to the body.”

However, this matter was so strange that it even piqued his curiosity, so he summoned Ming Buxiang for a detailed inquiry. Ming Buxiang said, “This disciple was only thinking that adversity reveals true character. By pushing them to their limit, they would think of things they couldn’t when they were blinded by anger.”

Jueming nodded repeatedly and sighed, “For Liaoxin to have a disciple like you, his life has not been in vain.”

Ming Buxiang replied, “Abbot, my master is not dead yet.”

Jueming laughed heartily, then asked, “Are your martial arts good enough to handle both of them?”

“Master taught me some. They were injured at the time and were no match for this disciple.”

Jueming nodded. “You are only fifteen and have already reached this level of ability with only Liaoxin to guide you. Your future is limitless. How about this: from now on, I will send people to teach you martial arts. Since you have not been ordained, I will make you an In-Hall Layman. In the future, you can help me with some official documents and records. What do you say?”

The position of In-Hall Layman was created to accommodate unordained disciples in the temple. It held no official rank and was not bound by the temple’s rules. Those who held it were often advisors or trusted aides to the first seats and the abbot. For Ming Buxiang to receive such an honor at the age of fifteen was unprecedented. Of course, Jueming’s deeper intention was that since Ming Buxiang was unwilling to take another master, this was the only way to cultivate his talents. Furthermore, the boy was so clever and resourceful that he might offer different perspectives on matters than the other In-Hall Laymen; by listening to all sides, it would aid his own judgment in temple affairs.

Ming Buxiang bowed with his hands clasped. “Morning sweeping is this disciple’s duty and also a part of my cultivation. I dare not neglect it. I will come to the inner hall to handle affairs in the afternoon.”

Jueming nodded. “Brother Juejian praised you, and I always thought he was exaggerating, but I see now you are truly so intelligent and modest. If you wish to continue sweeping, then you may do so.”

Ming Buxiang thanked Jueming and left the Hall of True Insight.

He returned to his quarters and completed the weapon diagram he had been painstakingly devising at the Chan Wind Teahouse a few days prior.

It was a weapon of his own design, a strangely shaped weapon of which there was no other in the world.
