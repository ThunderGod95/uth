# Chapter 7: Portraits of the Floating World

"The Mount Song Sect?" Liaojing's brows shot up in anger. "You want me to go to Mount Song?" He gave a scornful laugh. "Leave my master to die and become a complete traitor to Shaolin? You call that helping me?"

"Where is Shaolin?" Ming Buxiang countered.

Liaojing pointed up the mountain, toward the path he meant to take, but he stopped himself before speaking.

Ming Buxiang was not one to ask pointless questions; his words were always precise, a precision born of his intentions. His recent clashes with Ming Buxiang had given him a deeper understanding of the man. When Ming Buxiang asked where Shaolin was, he was not referring to the temple on the peak.

"Without Shaolin, where will you go back to?" Ming Buxiang asked.

Liaojing lowered his hand. "Are you saying I can either live like a dog or die like a worm?"

"Or you could be a hero, depending on your luck," Ming Buxiang said calmly. "This is as far as I can help you."

Liaojing burst out laughing.

"You, so kindhearted?" he sneered. "Bu Gui trusted you too."

"That was his own decision."

"You push a man off a cliff, and it's the rocks that killed him, is that what you mean?"

"I only led him to the cliff's edge. He jumped himself," Ming Buxiang said. "Yao Yunda and the others didn't jump."

"You drove Benyue mad and got Liaowu killed, that was still you, wasn't it? And what about Lady Yuan's husband…" Liaojing said. "They certainly didn't choose to go mad and die!"

"You were the one who killed them, and you wanted to kill me too," Ming Buxiang countered. "Did Benyue not deserve to die?"

Liaojing sneered, "You weren't acting out of kindness. You were afraid Benyue would expose everything and implicate you, so you moved against him."

"And you are acting out of kindness?"

A hint of weariness entered Ming Buxiang's voice.

"Is going up the mountain now your idea of compassion?" He shook his head. "It will only lead to more deaths."

"And you're afraid of people dying?" Liaojing laughed. "Don't tell me you don't kill!"

Ming Buxiang considered this as if it were a question of great importance, taking a long moment before replying, "Perhaps. I will have to, eventually."

When he spoke of killing, his face remained completely devoid of expression, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. His only consideration was when, where, and under what circumstances he would act.

A sudden chill went through Liaojing, and he demanded, "Who do you want to kill?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "I don't know yet. We'll see when the time comes."

"What if I don't go back to the temple?" Liaojing asked again. "Can you save my master? Even if I don't go up the mountain, won't the conflict between the orthodox and secular monks still break out?"

Ming Buxiang replied, "I can't save your master, and neither can you. Neither you nor I started the conflict between the orthodox and secular monks; we don't have that kind of power. It is cause and effect, a shared karma that no one can stop."

Liaojing said, "You certainly wash your hands of it all!"

Ming Buxiang said, "Bensong and Lady Yuan haven't gotten far. They will be captured, and that will be two more lives lost." He pointed south. "Head toward Wudang, and you can catch up to them. With your skills, you can protect them until they reach Wudang. Then, detour through Jiangsu to Shandong, where the Mount Song Sect is. You can renounce your vows there."

Finished, Ming Buxiang looked up the mountain again. "I should be getting back."

Liaojing asked, "Who are you planning to harm next? Abbot Juejian? First Seat Juekong?"

Ming Buxiang shook his head. "You still don't understand."

"No, I don't. With your intelligence and talent, the abbot's position would be yours sooner or later without resorting to these schemes. What is it you're really after?"

Ming Buxiang did not reply, and simply started up the mountain.

Liaojing watched his retreating back, hesitating for a long moment before a surge of anger rose in his chest, and he shouted, "Ming Buxiang! Even if I can't defeat you, someday, someone will deal with a monster like you! And when they do, I'll be there to help!"

Ming Buxiang paid him no mind, his figure gradually shrinking in the distance.

Liaojing knelt facing the direction of the Shaolin Temple and kowtowed three times, striking his head against the ground until his forehead bled, then he rose, turned, and strode quickly down the mountain.

He did not trust Ming Buxiang, but he knew that what Ming Buxiang had said was right.

His master would not want him to return, and he could not return. For him to go back would be a disaster for the Shaolin Temple.

This departure was a final farewell, his future stretching out before him, vast and unknown. He told himself that one day he would return to Shaolin, and he would face Ming Buxiang again.

The figure descending the mountain moved faster and faster, gradually disappearing into the forest, never to be seen again.

Juekong's first problem was the autopsy report Juejian handed him regarding the seven bodies discovered on Mount Song. It read: "Death likely due to fighting, pending further investigation."

Why not write "Cause of death unknown, culprit at large"? Juekong knew what Juejian was thinking. If Juejian had written that, Juekong would have leverage over him if Liaoxin were found and it turned out to be a fight between orthodox and secular monks, or if the truth came out later; it would be seen as covering for Liaoxin and concealing the facts.

This could become a major or minor issue, and a better approach would have been to bypass Juekong entirely, send it straight to the abbot, and convene the Four Courts to directly convict Liaoxin of murdering his brethren and fleeing justice. This would have been the consensus of the Four Courts, unrelated to the orthodox-secular divide, and Juekong had always thought that, given Juejian's worldliness, this would have been his move.

So when he saw the autopsy report, he was genuinely shocked.

The Universal Virtue Court was in charge of all discipline and law enforcement within and without the Shaolin Temple; now that it was in his hands, passing it up to the Four Courts would signify his inability to make a decision on the matter.

Had even Juejian started playing these petty tricks? The only path after that would be to send it back to the Universal Virtue Court for re-examination, and Juejian must have anticipated this possibility. Since he had submitted it, he had no intention of changing it.

Should he write "Cause of death unknown, culprit at large" and close the case? Shielding an orthodox monk would be a simple matter for him. Orthodox and secular monks had always received different punishments for the same crime, with secular monks often getting off lightly, especially regarding monastic rules, but harming a fellow monk was a capital offense even for a secular monk.

What was Juejian plotting? With the orthodox and secular factions now latently opposed, was he trying to pin the label of protecting an orthodox monk on Juekong, making himself appear strict with the precepts while making it hard for Juekong to answer to the secular monks and also bear the crime of favoritism?

This Juejian…

In the end, Juekong still settled on "Death likely due to fighting, pending further investigation."

He had to make the secular monks believe he would protect their status and stand up for them.

As long as he held authority and the secular monks' trust, he could control the nearly sixty percent of Shaolin they comprised and prevent them from mutinying and causing a catastrophe.

Power was a dangerous weapon that had to be in the hands of someone with sufficient wisdom and conviction.

And the way to maintain authority was to never allow others to infringe upon or test it.

Once you let someone step on your foot, they would follow by stepping on your face, and when others saw it, they would think they could step on you too.

He just hadn't expected that while the Bu Gui incident was small, the commotion it caused was not. The secular monks believed Bu Gui was on the orthodox monks' side, while the orthodox monks believed that since Bu Gui's master was close to the secular monks, Bu Gui was one of them, and it became a pretext for both sides to attack each other.

What he expected even less was that Jueguan and Jueru would bring up the matter of changing the secular monks' names at such a critical juncture.

'Two idiots,' Juekong thought, 'Jueru's cleverness is limited to just talk.'

He only saw the conflict between orthodox and secular, and failed to see the bigger picture.

The Bensong affair was both a crisis and an opportunity.

If Jueru died, the secular monks' anger would be appeased, and the matter of changing their names could be suppressed.

And with that, Shaolin would be stable.

Juekong remembered the words his master had once spoken.

They were words that, for Shaolin, could be considered heretical. And because of that, he had never mentioned them to anyone.

They were the creed he had followed his entire life.

※

Jueguan and Juejian went to see Jueru in the prison, and Jueru was still all smiles.

Jueguan said, "You can still smile after causing such a huge mess."

Jueru laughed. "I saved my disciple, of course I'm happy."

"You failed to control your disciple," Juejian said, his face still stern; he saw nothing funny in this. "Bensong broke the precepts, and Liaojing even covered for him to escape."

Jueru chuckled. "Bensong isn't my disciple, he's Liaoxu's. Liaoxu is a Proctor Monk of the Hall of Upright Action, which is under your watch. So really, it's your lax supervision that has brought misery upon my disciple and me."

Jueguan asked, "Do you know where your disciple has gone?"

"First Seat, isn't that a pointless question? Never mind that I don't know, even if I did, would I tell you? Do you think I enjoy sitting in jail, that I'm just napping in here on purpose?"

"These are not ordinary times. You have a great responsibility. If the renaming of the secular monks cannot be settled now, how will the Three Jewels survive?"

Jueru paused for a moment, looked around, and sighed. "Then I suppose the Buddha is not watching over us."

Juejian said, "You ruin the true law for your own selfish reasons and then push the blame onto the World-Honored One? This is you reaping what you have sown."

"I'm about to die anyway. I'll just confess to the Buddha after I'm gone."

Juejian said, "I fear you won't get to see the World-Honored One."

Jueru laughed heartily. "After a few hundred more lifetimes, everyone gets to see the Buddha. I'll just tell him then. Cultivation is the work of countless eons; what's a tiny mistake like this on the long road of practice?"

Jueguan said, "That's just sophistry. This is no tiny mistake. Secular monks are tarnishing the good name of Buddhism in the outside world by using the name of the Three Jewels, frequenting prostitutes, marrying and having children, gambling, and drinking, showing no sign of cultivation at all. How is a common person to tell if you are a real monk or a fake one? They will think all Buddhist disciples are like this."

"The abbot hasn't made his decision yet; there may still be a chance," Juejian said, looking at Jueru. "Fortunately, the orthodox monks still outnumber the secular monks by one vote. Otherwise, you'd really be smiling in the netherworld."

Jueru just laughed loudly again.

After Jueguan and Juejian left, Juewen came to see him.

"I'm surprised you came," Jueru said, genuinely amazed. Although they were both abbots of the Observing Sufferings Court, Juewen was a secular monk, and their personalities clashed. Juewen had always been reserved, and Jueru's jokes had never once amused him; he found his company quite dull.

"During the Four Courts' council, I voted for your death," Juewen said, sitting on the floor. "That was not my true intention."

"I understand. First Seat Juekong wants me dead, right? If I die, the matter of renaming the secular monks will be dropped."

"Renaming the secular monks is not about creating distinctions," Juewen said. "I understand yours and First Seat Jueguan's thinking."

Jueru smiled. "Then tell me, how is it you understand?"

Juewen said, "The rules of the Shaolin Temple state that only ordained monks may enter the halls. This cannot be changed."

Jueru nodded. "Mm-hm, it can't be changed. Otherwise, the lay disciples would outnumber the monks, and that would be a disaster."

Juewen continued, "Renaming the secular monks wouldn't change the internal rules, but it would clarify our position to the outside world and prevent misunderstandings about the Three Jewels. This was originally a good thing."

"If it's a good thing, why didn't you support it? Are you really that afraid of First Seat Juekong?"

Juewen shook his head. "Our predecessors fifty years ago did not foresee this. Today, fifty years later, it is too late."

"Better late than never. If we don't do it now, will Shaolin be able to call itself the true lineage of Buddhism in the future?"

Juewen was silent.

Jueru said, "We should have swapped masters back then. If you had become an orthodox monk, you'd be Juejian, if not Jueming. If I had become a secular monk, I would have taken Jueji's place, and things wouldn't be so awkward now."

Juewen sighed. "In this world, even cultivation is difficult."

※

Jueming did not go to see Jueru. He went to the abbot's room and knocked twice on the door.

"Come in," came Juesheng's voice from within. Jueming pushed the door open to find the abbot sitting on a prayer mat.

"I thought it would be your turn soon," Juesheng said, pointing to two prayer mats before him. "Sit."

Two prayer mats? Jueming guessed what that meant. "First Seat Jueyun and Abbot Jueguang, I presume?" he asked.

"Correct. You are the last from the Unique Wisdom Court who has not come."

"Juejian is the abbot of the Hall of Upright Action, so he must remain neutral. Jueguan is close with Jueru, so saying too much would risk being seen as letting personal feelings compromise public duty. Liaozheng is a newly appointed abbot with the lowest seniority, so he dares not act rashly."

Juesheng asked, "What are you trying to say?"

Jueming thought for a moment, then placed his hands on the floor and performed a deep bow to Juesheng.

"What I wish to say, the abbot already understands." With that single sentence, he stood up, opened the door, and left. Jueming, the man to whom Not a Single Leaf Clings, had finally, in his own way, spoken his mind to protect Jueru.

Of course Juesheng understood what Jueming wanted to say. As the leading figure of the martial sects and the abbot of the Shaolin Temple, the highest sacred ground of Buddhism, he was the most respected person in the martial world, second only to the leader of the Kunlun council.

He had the power to control the lives and deaths of thousands, yet he was an eminent monk of such compassion that he would mourn the death of any single person.

Let alone someone like Jueru.

He rose and pushed open the door. It was a beautiful, breezy afternoon in April.

Could Jueru still feel this gentle breeze and warm sun?

In terms of cultivation, Jueru was not a diligent monk. But he was a capable administrator with a ready smile, more beloved by the disciples than the other stern orthodox monks. And he was not entirely inflexible. Juejian was worldly, but Jueru was even more adaptable and knew how to scheme, striking ruthlessly when necessary. He presided over the Hall of True Speech with a mix of kindness and authority, ensuring that the temple's administrative matters were communicated clearly and executed properly. Such talent was rare among the orthodox monks. Moreover, Jueru's fierce desire to protect his disciple was understandable; his crime did not warrant death.

But Juekong was right. If they did not kill Jueru, how could they appease the secular monks?

Jueru had to die.

So was he killing him because he was guilty, or because he had to die?

Juesheng raised his head. A small spiderweb in the corner of the eaves had just snared a green fly.

He had specifically instructed the disciples to leave that small corner of the eaves untouched when cleaning, so that spiders could spin their webs and catch food. But this web had also become the green fly's tomb. His compassion had, at the same time, condemned many lives.

"Cause and effect..." he sighed softly. Who was to know if saving one person today might not cause the deaths of more tomorrow?

But if he stood by and did nothing today, how could he know it wouldn't lead to others' deaths in the future?

His compassionate brows lowered, his eyes slightly closed, and he softly chanted a Buddhist phrase.

※

Liaojing left Shaolin under the cover of night and found an inn in the town below the mountain, where he ordered two catties of baigan liquor.

Monks drinking was no longer strange within the jurisdiction of the Shaolin Temple; after leaving the Buddha Capital, many secular monks would drink. Seeing the innkeeper deliver the alcohol without so much as a question, Liaojing suddenly understood why his master had been so insistent on the matter of renaming the secular monks.

But that was no longer his concern, Liaojing thought with a bitter smile, pouring a cup of liquor and raising it to his chest. He muttered to himself, "To the first cup of my new secular life!"

He downed it in one gulp, then sputtered it out with a gasp.

"Spicy! Spicy! Innkeeper, bring me a cup of tea, quickly!" Liaojing yelled in a panic. The innkeeper hurriedly brewed a pot of hot tea for him. Liaojing tilted his head back and drank a large mouthful, only to spray it out again, sticking out his tongue and shouting, "Hot! Hot!"

He hastily drank another cup of liquor to cool the burn.

He had never drunk alcohol before; this was his first time, and his face instantly flushed crimson.

"What's so good about this stuff anyway?" Liaojing wondered.

He poured a second cup. As the first step to renouncing his vows, he was determined to first learn how to drink.

After the second cup, the slight buzz brought his suppressed emotions to the surface. He felt he had so much to say, but no one to say it to. It was late, and the inn was preparing to close. He would have to stay the night, and he wasn't sure if he had enough money for a room.

In the inn's main hall, only a single scholar in blue robes sat in a corner, reading a book by candlelight and sipping tea.

"Hey, you, the scholar!" Liaojing called out. "Care to join me for a drink?"

The scholar looked up at Liaojing, closed his book, and walked over.

"What book are you reading?" Liaojing asked, glancing at the man's hands. The scholar held up the book; it was a copy of _In Search of the Supernatural_.

"I've read that one, it's pretty interesting," Liaojing said, turning to the innkeeper. "Innkeeper, another cup!"

The innkeeper quickly handed over a cup and asked, "Will the guest be staying the night? The inn is closing soon."

"How much for the night?" Liaojing asked.

"Including the liquor, five hundred wen."

Liaojing reached into his robes, a hesitant look on his face.

"You buy me a drink, I'll pay for your room. Fair's fair," the scholar said, seeming to see through his predicament, and turned to the innkeeper. "Put his room on my bill."

Liaojing didn't try to act tough and quickly thanked him. Looking closely at the scholar now, he saw that he had a handsome, refined face with a faint smile.

'That smile seems familiar,' Liaojing thought, but he couldn't recall where he had seen the man before. He could only pour a cup for himself and another for his new companion.

"Cheers!" Liaojing drained his cup, a wave of dizziness washing over him. The scholar drank his cup as well.

"To meet by chance is to be linked by fate," Liaojing said. "Where are you headed, sir?"

The scholar replied, "I had intended to go up to Shaolin for the Buddha's Birthday celebration, but I was delayed on the road and missed it."

"What's so great about Shaolin? There's a monster there!"

"A monster? Like the ones in this book?" the scholar asked, raising _In Search of the Supernatural_.

"Those are fake. I'm talking about a real one." Liaojing's head was spinning, and his chest felt fit to burst with all the words he had held back, the grievances of the past few days ready to erupt. He pulled Ming Buxiang's notebook from his robes and handed it to the scholar.

"Here, look at this. Do you believe what's written in here?"

The scholar opened the notebook and began to read by the candlelight. He flipped through the pages very quickly, making Liaojing doubt if he was actually reading the words.

"So, you don't believe it either, right?" Liaojing sighed, poured another drink for both of them, and downed his. "That's even my handwriting on it. Doesn't it just look like a load of nonsense I made up?"

"I believe you," the scholar said, returning the notebook to Liaojing, and asked calmly, "Is he the reason you're leaving the temple and renouncing your vows?"

Hearing this, Liaojing broke out in a cold sweat, his mind clearing instantly. He asked warily, "How did you know I'm renouncing my vows and leaving the temple?"

"If such a person truly exists and you know so many of his secrets, he would never allow you to remain at Shaolin," the scholar said. "You are not a drinker; tonight is your first time, and you are clearly troubled. Your shoes are caked in mud from traveling a mountain path by night. The nearest mountain settlement is the Buddha Capital, which means you came down from the Shaolin Temple. If you were on urgent official business, you would be on horseback. If not, why travel in such a hurry? This indicates you have fled. It is clear you intend to renounce your vows."

Liaojing stared at the scholar in astonishment.

"We are close to the Shaolin Temple here, so news travels fast. I've heard about what's been happening recently. You must be Master Liaojing, correct?"

Liaojing nodded. As if sensing the suspicion in his eyes, the scholar continued, "I will not expose you. You are a good man."

Liaojing gave a bitter laugh. "How would you know?"

The scholar raised his cup. "Didn't you offer to buy me a drink?"

"Ha!" Liaojing laughed loudly, poured two more cups, and raised his. "To this good man!"

The two drank again, and the scholar said, "I'm very interested in this monster you speak of. Could you tell me more?"

Liaojing, filled with pent-up frustration and days of grievances that no one would believe, now finally had a willing ear and let everything pour out. He drank as he spoke, from discovering the manuscript page in the scripture repository to his master taking the blame for him, all the way to his own escape from Shaolin.

He had never drunk before, and by the time he realized he was drunk, his head was spinning and he could barely speak clearly.

"This stuff... it's pretty wild, right? ... He's only fifteen... who'd believe it."

The scholar said, "It may seem outlandish, but with enough planning beforehand, it's not impossible."

Liaojing chuckled. "Really?"

"Master, you are drunk. You should rest."

Liaojing slurred, "There's more... later... I saw him again... when I was about to go back to Shaolin..."

He trailed off, overcome with drowsiness, his words becoming incoherent. "I... you... what's your name..."

"My name is Xie Gubei. Master, we shall meet again if fate allows."

Liaojing said, "Xie... Gu..." He fell into a deep sleep before he could finish. He shouldn't have drunk something so strong, what was it called, baigan... for many years after, he regretted ordering baigan that day, and never drank it again.

That night, Liaojing crawled out of bed and threw up a great deal into the chamber pot. His mouth was dry, his head was splitting, and he fumbled in the dark for the water jug, drinking it dry before collapsing back onto the bed.

The next morning, he found a note on the table with just twelve words written on it—

"The peaks of Song are not Shaolin's alone; there is room enough for a hidden dragon to dwell."

Was this comparing him to a hidden dragon? High praise indeed. Liaojing scratched his chin and gave a wry smile.

The meaning of these twelve words also seemed to be urging him to go to Mount Song, just as Ming Buxiang had said. He suddenly remembered why the scholar had seemed familiar. The scholar's smile reminded him of Ming Buxiang. No, strictly speaking, their smiles were completely different. When Ming Buxiang smiled, it was like the warm, gentle sun, while the scholar's was detached and distant. Yet for some reason, that smile made him think of Ming Buxiang, even though they looked nothing alike.

He asked the innkeeper about the man from yesterday. The innkeeper said the scholar had been staying for two days and seemed to have been planning to go up the mountain, but for some reason, he had left last night. Maybe he went up the mountain, maybe not.

Liaojing felt a sense of regret. He knew that man was no ordinary person and cursed himself for not being able to befriend him.

Mount Song...

He had been skeptical of Ming Buxiang's words, but now this scholar was also telling him to go to Mount Song. If what they both said wasn't a coincidence, then there had to be a reason he must go there.

On the road to Wudang, he found Bensong and his companion. They had nearly been caught by Shaolin's Hall Monks. Liaojing protected them as they fled to Hubei, then made their way to Anhui. At the very least, he had saved two people.

On the way to Mount Song, he finally heard how the Shaolin Temple had dealt with his master, Jueru.

Demoted five ranks, exiled from Shaolin, and reassigned as the abbot of Baima Temple in Shanxi.

He didn't know whether to be relieved or worried.

Within the Shaolin Temple, the sound of bells was long and melodious, and the chanting of scriptures was endless.

Juekong could not change the fact that Abbot Juesheng had publicly announced his decision: Jueru was to be exiled to White Horse Temple in Shanxi, and the new abbot of the Hall of True Speech would be recommended by First Seat Juekong.

Abbot Juesheng had done his best to mitigate the consequences of this decision. Letting Juekong recommend the abbot for the Hall of True Speech meant that the Four Courts and Eight Halls would be evenly split between the orthodox and secular factions.

Only Juekong knew that amid swelling anger, a resolution that seemed to be a compromise that pleased both sides often served only to deepen the conflict.

He stood before the main hall of the Universal Virtue Court and suddenly thought of his master's words again.

Those words, which for the Shaolin Temple, were the most heretical of all:

"The Buddha may perish, but Shaolin must not!"

## Side Story: Juekong

In Kaifeng, Henan, everyone knew of the Mu family. They had made their fortune in the silk trade and were the largest and most influential clan in the region, with over seventy households and more than six hundred relatives living locally. In these times, the phrase "wealth to rival a nation" was outdated, and of course, such an exaggeration was too much even for a family like the Mu, but "wealth to rival a sect" was quite fitting—referring, of course, to sects outside the Nine Great Families.

To facilitate travel between relatives, as soon as the world had settled into a period of peace, the clan head, Mu Kun, enclosed a large plot of land, a full five li in circumference, with a four-zhang-high wall.

The wall was wide enough for people to walk on, complete with watchtowers, and had gates on the east and west sides large enough for a four-horse carriage to pass through. Inside, the streets were orderly, lined with over a hundred manors and mansions for the clansmen to live in. It was a massive undertaking, employing thousands of craftsmen over the years. Mu Kun did not live to see its completion, passing away after fifteen years.

The new clan head was Mu Kun's eldest son, Mu Qing. Mu Qing followed his father's instructions and continued the project. Seven years later, Mu Qing had a son, whom he gave the single name Jie, with the courtesy name Guzhi. Mu Qing's hope was that the boy would be diligent and hardworking, and would preserve the family's legacy. Three years after that, the Mu Family Manor was finally completed, and Mu Qing inscribed its name.

This small city took a full twenty-five years to build.

As this was the Mu family's residence, it logically should have been named a _garden,_ but _Mu Garden_ sounded terrible and was taboo. 

Besides, a complex of this scale could no longer be called a mere residence; it was more like a small city. But to call it _Mu City_ was too strange, and _Mu Fortress_ had too much of a martial world flavor. 

The Mu family were merely merchants, and the clansmen who practiced martial arts did so mostly for recreation. Mu Qing was a practical and down-to-earth man who didn't want some clever or ostentatious name, so he simply wrote _Mu Family Manor._

On the day the Mu Family Manor was completed, Mu Qing hosted a thousand-table banquet that ran for seven days straight, with food and drink served day and night. Local residents and traveling merchants from north and south, rich or poor, young or old, were all welcomed with fine wine and good food.

The completion of such an unconventional and magnificent residence was a source of pride for the residents of Kaifeng. Coupled with Mu Qing's devout Buddhist faith and his good reputation in the area, people spread the news, and for those few days, Kaifeng was a picture of peace, prosperity, and festive cheer.

Yet amid the revelry, only an old fortune-teller in the east of the city was gloomy. He had read the manor's feng shui and, seeing how it was sealed off on all sides, sighed and said, "With the Mu clan walled inside, is that not the very picture of being trapped?"

He shook his head endlessly, finished his meal at the banquet, wrapped up half a leftover chicken, swiped a bottle of cheap wine, and went home to drown his sorrows.

In addition to the seventy-plus households of over six hundred Mu family members, this small city was also home to three hundred guards, eight hundred servants, a hundred fine steeds in the stables, and several hundred jars of fine Shaoxing wine in the cellars.

Mu Qing was not a man given to drink or luxury; he only drank in moderation. These seemingly extravagant expenses were merely the normal costs of daily life for the Mu family, not to mention the thousand bushels of grain in the granaries and the countless chickens, ducks, cattle, and sheep in the pens.

Mu Qing's father, Mu Kun, had not built this small city simply for his own amusement or to isolate himself from the world. He had witnessed too many feuds and chaotic conflicts in the martial sects, and in that era of newly found peace, it was a precaution. Even though thirty years had passed since the Kunlun council, fights still broke out in the martial world from time to time.

Mu Qing understood this. Every year on Buddha's Birthday, he would take his family to Shaolin to pay homage and donate a considerable sum of money. On the way back, he would also visit the Mount Song Sect, east of Mount Shaoshi. No matter how much he donated to Shaolin that year, the amount given to the Zhongyue Temple of Mount Song was always the same. The only difference was that his offering to Shaolin came from piety, while his offering to Mount Song was out of courtesy.

A monk and a Daoist, separated only by Mount Shaoshi. Shaolin lay to its west, Mount Song to its east.

Kaifeng just so happened to be east of Mount Shaoshi.

After the Kunlun council, the Nine Great Families divided their territories; the Mount Song of the past was merely the largest sect under Shaolin's jurisdiction. Thirty years went by, and within Shaolin Temple, only the chanting of sutras could be heard, not the clamor of the secular world.

Twenty-five years ago, the number of Mount Song disciples in Kaifeng gradually increased, and the Tiejian Gate of Shangqiu began to show a subtle deference to Mount Song that surpassed even their respect for Shaolin.

Twenty-two years ago, the Taishan Sect and the Mount Song Sect were joined by marriage, and from then on, the two were inseparable.

Eighteen years ago, the mounted bandits within Shandong’s borders were completely eradicated. Under the pretext of protecting their homeland, disciples of Mount Song established numerous Daoist monasteries throughout Shandong, accepting students and teaching their arts.

Nine years ago, a wanted fugitive from Wudang fled to Shandong, where he was captured and killed by Mount Song disciples. His body was sent back to Wudang, yet the Proctor Monk from Shaolin stationed at Lingyan Temple remained completely unaware.

Now, all the martial sects in Shandong, large and small, answered only to the call of Mount Song.

The areas of Kaifeng and Shangqiu, situated at a vital pass from Shandong to Shaolin Temple, became awkward territories. Due to their proximity to Shaolin, monks were a common sight in these two places, and though temples were numerous, Daoist monasteries were not few.

It was only after the completion of the Mu Family Manor that Mu Qing felt a measure of peace.

From a young age, Mu Jie was much taller and larger than other children his age. For as long as he could remember, he had lived in the Mu Family Manor; whenever he stepped outside, he was greeted by uncles, aunts, and cousins, and the manor’s maids and servants were at his beck and call. His food, clothing, and all necessities were of the finest quality. At the age of five, a tutor was hired to teach him reading and writing. On the rare occasions he left the manor, he was flanked by bodyguards and attendants, like a little prince in his own five-li kingdom.

When Mu Jie was six, Mount Song sent out invitations across the martial sects for a grand martial world banquet. This move completely bypassed Shaolin Temple, but for some unknown reason, Shaolin did not seem to mind and even sent an envoy to attend.

At the banquet, envoys from the Nine Great Families gathered, among them Yan Yingqi, the younger brother of the Mount Hua sect leader. The Beggar's Sect also sent Peng Zhenhao, the then-Fuzhou branch leader from the Five Tigers Severing Blade Peng family.

Peng Zhenhao also had a nickname, Peng Laogai. Though he was called 'lao', meaning old, he was only thirty-five at the time. While his position as a branch leader was low, he was a heroic figure whose fame had been rising in recent years. Many believed he would one day become one of the Beggar's Sect's three chief leaders, so sending him was a gesture of respect toward Mount Song without being overly formal. It was a rather masterful stroke of etiquette.

At the martial world banquet, the Mount Song Sect publicly announced its name change to the Songyang Sect, taking 'yang' from its position on the sunny side of Mount Song, leaving the 'yin' side to Shaolin, so as to avoid the biased perception that Shaolin alone represented Mount Song. They also asked the Wudang envoy to report to the then-leader of the Kunlun council—Wudang's Daoist Master Gu Song of Wudang Sect—stating that as they shared a common Daoist origin, they wished to form an alliance.

This time, no matter how obstinate or dull-witted Shaolin Temple was, it could not remain silent. To mention Mount Song had always been to refer to Shaolin Temple. The Mount Song Sect changing its name to Songyang, while ostensibly to avoid confusion, was in reality an act of division. Since the Mount Song Sect was under Shaolin's jurisdiction, what was wrong with referring to Mount Song as Shaolin? Furthermore, the Mount Song Sect was not one of the Nine Great Families, so what right did it have to form an alliance with Wudang?

Consequently, at the banquet, the Shaolin envoy accused the Mount Song Sect of overstepping its bounds. The Mount Song Sect leader, Cao Lingxue, seized the opportunity to launch a counter-accusation, charging Shaolin Temple with being out of touch with worldly affairs and incompetent in its governance, before driving the Shaolin monks out.

The envoys from the various sects knew this was no small matter and quickly took their leave to report back to their respective sects. Cao Lingxue specifically asked Yan Yingqi of the Mount Hua Sect to stay for a private discussion, after which Yan Yingqi departed alone.

What followed was the outbreak of the Shao-Song Conflict, in the fifth month of the thirty-third year of the Kunlun council.

In the largest sectarian conflict since the Kunlun council, the course of the battle was astonishing. The Zhongyue Temple and Shaolin were separated by only a single mountain. The Shaolin envoy's front foot had barely crossed the temple threshold when the Mount Song Sect mobilized its full strength, with over a thousand disciples surrounding Shaolin Temple. At the time, the eminent monks in power at Shaolin were mostly of the 'Zhi' generation, and Abbot Zhiquan ordered the temple gates to be sealed to avoid the enemy.

This first step was a mistake. The Mount Song Sect's strength was no match for Shaolin's; although caught by surprise, Shaolin Temple still had over a thousand Hall Monks. A charge to break the siege would not have put them at a disadvantage. But Zhiquan was a virtuous and eminent monk who could not bear the thought of bloodshed and wished only to repel the attack through peaceful means.

This delay gave the Mount Song Sect time to send word, and all the clans and sects within Shandong responded, arriving in succession. In less than a month, the number of people surrounding Shaolin had grown to over three thousand, and by then, Shaolin could not fight even if it wanted to. Not only that, but the temple's grain and supplies were dwindling, while Mount Song reinforcements continued to arrive.

Cao Lingxue surrounded Shaolin but did not attack, instead setting up ambushes at various strategic points. Upon hearing their sacred ground was under siege, Shaolin disciples from Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi rushed to the rescue. The abbots of the various temples, though advanced in their spiritual cultivation, were not skilled in warfare. The relief forces acted independently, each claiming they would rendezvous at Shaolin but with no one to coordinate them. Before they even reached Mount Shaoshi, they were ambushed at various choke points and were either killed or wounded. This strategy of besieging the fortress to annihilate the reinforcements left Shaolin Temple utterly helpless.

Abbot Zhiquan waited in vain for reinforcements, and seeing the temple depleted of food, he had no choice but to fight. The temple gates swung open, and a thousand monks poured out. The Mount Song Sect broke and fled in a single engagement, retreating deep into the woods outside the temple. The monks, believing victory was in their grasp, pressed their advantage towards the Zhongyue Temple, only to be ambushed halfway. 

A great fire in the woods killed more than two hundred monks and wounded over four hundred. The first seats of the Universal Virtue Court and the Observing Sufferings Court, along with the abbots of the Hall of True Speech, the Hall of True Vocation, and the Hall of True Progress, were killed in battle. The first seat of the Unique Wisdom Court led his men in a desperate fight to escape back to the temple. Of the more than one thousand who charged out, only four hundred made it back; the rest were either dead or captured.

It was said that Peng Laogai, who was in Hubei at the time, commented on the matter: "Well, that's one way to solve the food problem. I just wonder if the monks have the stomach for Daoist cooking."

Abbot Zhiquan was at his wit's end. His Buddhist heart was filled with grief, and he held a ceremony, chanting sutras to deliver the souls of the dead. It would not have been difficult for Mount Song to take Shaolin at this point, and just as the thousand-year-old monastery was on the brink of falling, Cao Lingxue suddenly halted his troops.

Meanwhile, another, lesser-known incident occurred: Yan Yingqi caused trouble within Wudang's territory. Many people thought this was an unrelated event, but no one asked why Yan Yingqi had appeared in Wudang in the first place.

The flames of war also reached the Mu Family Manor in Kaifeng.

After the Shao-Song Conflict began, Mu Qing ordered all clan members not to leave the Mu Family Manor, and over two hundred hired guards and bodyguards patrolled day and night.

The first group of martial world figures to set foot in Kaifeng belonged to the Mount Song Sect. They had received instructions early on to enter from Shandong and pass through Kaifeng. They immediately rushed to reinforce Shaolin without lingering in the city. The subsequent waves of Mount Song forces, whether fifty or a hundred or two, did the same.

It was not until two months later that news of Shaolin Temple's great defeat arrived, and panic spread. Mu Qing had already prepared for the worst; even if Kaifeng fell into the hands of the Mount Song Sect, it would not affect the Mu family's livelihood. But if the war dragged on, it would be another story.

It was September when over two hundred Shaolin disciples from Xinyang bypassed the ambushes and reached Kaifeng. They planned to gather forces there and attack the Mount Song Sect from the rear.

They learned that another group from Mount Song, numbering around three hundred, had also arrived in Kaifeng from Shandong.

An encounter battle was bound to unfold in Kaifeng.

Thus, the fortress and terrain of the Mu Family Manor became the key to victory or defeat. Whoever occupied the Mu Family Manor, with the advantage of its walls, could secure an unbeatable position. For Shaolin Temple, the manor would be an excellent base for them to rally their forces.

The Shaolin disciples came from the west gate, while the Mount Song disciples arrived from the east. Neither side realized that only the Mu Family Manor separated them from the other party as they simultaneously sent visiting cards, requesting Mu Qing grant them passage into the manor to prepare for battle.

Mu Qing was immediately thrown into a dilemma. Though he was a devout Buddhist, he did not wish to offend Mount Song, especially after hearing of Shaolin's crushing defeat. Letting either side in would be difficult. Moreover, he had heard that a large number of Shaolin disciples were on their way, and with Shandong nearby, many disciples from the Taishan Sect were also rushing to Kaifeng as reinforcements.

Mu Qing returned the invitation cards, politely refusing both parties and offering no aid; it was the best solution he could think of.

However, things did not go as planned. Immediately after his refusal, more than a hundred disciples from the Mount Song Sect launched an attack on the Mu Family Manor. Occupying the manor would give them a topographical advantage, which was too important for them to pass up.

Mu Kun had spent twenty-five years hoping to build a fortress to shelter his family, but now it had become the source of their misfortune. The hired bodyguards were no match for the formally trained disciples in martial arts, and the leisurely years at the Mu Family Manor had eroded their fighting spirit.

A dozen Mount Song disciples threw grappling hooks and scaled the walls. Some ropes were cut, sending men falling to a bloody end, but some of the more agile ones leaped onto the ramparts and battled with the guards. In a flash, more than ten were wounded or killed. More Mount Song disciples took the opportunity to scale the walls, and once their numbers grew, they quickly captured several sections of the wall and began moving toward the gate.

Seeing this, Mu Qing knew that regardless of the outcome, he had made an enemy of the Mount Song Sect. In a moment of desperate inspiration, he quickly sent men to open the west gate and welcome the Shaolin disciples to help with the defense.

By the time the Shaolin disciples reached the east gate, it had already been breached. Although the Mount Song disciples had lost over twenty men, the Mu family guards had suffered even heavier casualties. The Shaolin disciples charged into the fray with thunderous war cries. Each was a skilled martial artist, a world apart from the common guards. The Mount Song disciples were already weary from battle, and after a fierce fight, thirty more of their number were killed, while the rest retreated with their wounded.

Mu Qing immediately ordered the gates to be shut.

He knew that the Mu Family Manor had become a battlefield. He told his wife to pack their valuables and take their son, Mu Jie, to Wudang to seek refuge. He also told the rest of the Mu clan to disperse, while he himself remained to defend the manor.

More than twenty years ago, as a young boy, he had watched as the first patch of this wasteland was cleared and the first brick was laid. Even if it was to become scorched earth, he would stand guard here, protecting the Mu Family Manor of which he was so proud.

Before the clan members could even pack their belongings, Mu Qing ascended the wall the next morning. By the east gate, a cloud of dust could be seen rising in the distance. It was a column of at least five hundred men, with the character for 'Song' emblazoned on a banner fluttering in the wind.

On the wall, the leading Shaolin disciple shouted, "Everyone, do not panic! Senior Brother Zhang is on his way! When he arrives, these scoundrels will be nothing to fear!"

The Shaolin disciples roared in unison, their morale soaring, seemingly having immense faith in this Senior Brother Zhang.

Mu Qing had no confidence at all.

Before the Mount Song Sect could break through, the Mu clan members scattered, taking only some silver with them; the horses had to be left for the Shaolin monks to use in battle. Only Mu Jie and his mother, due to their special status, were given a carriage and two guards to escort them away.

And so, Mu Jie traveled with his mother toward Wudang. Halfway there, the two guards were overcome by greed, robbing them of their silver and carriage. Mother and son were forced to beg and flee all the way to Hubei. The hardships of the journey left an indelible mark on Mu Jie, who had never known suffering.

They finally reached Wudang, but the sect leader, Daoist Master Gu Song, was at Kunlun. The acting leader, Gu Xu, took them in. They stayed at Wudang for three months before new tidings arrived.

The Shao-Song Conflict, which had lasted eight months, was over.

The Mount Song Sect had suffered a great defeat. Cao Lingxue stepped down as sect leader, passing the position to his disciple Han Moying, and went to Shaolin to be imprisoned. Cao Lingxue would die of illness in Shaolin fifteen years later, but that is a story for another time. 

After the defeat, the Mount Song Sect also left the Zhongyue Temple and relocated to Mount Tai. To avoid escalating the conflict, although Shaolin was nominally the master of the Mount Song Sect, in reality, all affairs within Shandong, large or small, were handled by Mount Song itself, with no need for reporting.

The Shao-Song Conflict changed many things, but for the seven-year-old Mu Jie, the biggest change was his home.

The Mu Family Manor had been turned to scorched earth.

The walls had crumbled, and as far as the eye could see, there were only broken ramparts and ruined walls. The once-magnificent estate was reduced to ashes, and the gardens where he used to play were now devoid of birdsong and fragrant flowers. Twenty-five years of accumulation and hard work had been exchanged for less than three years of prosperity and a stretch of wasteland in desperate need of clearing.

Mu Jie saw his mother kneeling before their former home, weeping bitterly, but he did not see the father who was supposed to welcome him.

The one who came was a monk, about forty years old, with sharp brows and bright eyes, possessing a rather heroic air.

"This humble monk is Ziqiu. The 'qiu' from the saying 'a single leaf foretells autumn.' Might you be the young master of the Mu family?"

The Mu family was ruined, and the clan members never returned. The monk Ziqiu took in Mu Jie and his mother and built Pure Dew Temple on the old site of the Mu manor.

"Only by extinguishing the fires of karma with pure dew can one eliminate vexations, avert disaster, and pacify the spirits of the dead," Master Ziqiu said.

Mu Jie discovered that Master Ziqiu was very different from other monks. When his peers were chanting their morning and evening sutras, Master Ziqiu did not participate. Compared to the strictness of the other monks, Master Ziqiu's conduct seemed somewhat frivolous. As the abbot of Pure Dew Temple, he even had a wife and son.

"My name is Zhang Jizhi." The first time Mu Jie met Master Ziqiu's son was when he was ten. He wanted to take Ziqiu as his master, and Ziqiu introduced him to his son.

"He's two years older than you and started his training earlier. You'll have to call him senior brother from now on."

Mu Jie bowed and said, "Greetings, Senior Brother."

Zhang Jizhi tilted his head up, measured the space between their foreheads with his hand, and said in surprise, "You're really tall." 

Then he added, "Come on, Junior Brother, I'll take you to practice."

Ziqiu laughed, "You think you can teach someone with your clumsy skills? Go on, practice your horse stance."

Zhang Jizhi pouted, "Mother told me to go study."

Ziqiu said, "You must study, and you must practice martial arts. You can't neglect either. Have you forgotten your name?"

Zhang Jizhi replied, "My name is Zhang Jizhi. I am to inherit my father's reputation, to be skilled in both literary and martial arts, so as not to disappoint the great name of the 'Iron Brush Painting the Tides,' Zhang Qiuchi."

Ziqiu roared with laughter. "That's right. And after you finish reading, you must practice your calligraphy, understand?"

Zhang Jizhi nodded with great reluctance and pulled Mu Jie away.

From then on, Mu Jie practiced, wrote, and studied alongside Zhang Jizhi. Mu Jie surpassed Zhang Jizhi not only in height but also in talent, and he was far more diligent and hardworking.

His effort was a great mystery to Zhang Jizhi.

Once, Zhang Jizhi asked, "I've known you for so long and never seen you rest. Why do you work so hard?"

Mu Jie replied, "My father gave me the name Jie, with the courtesy name Guzhi, to remind me to be diligent and hardworking, to protect and maintain the family estate."

Zhang Jizhi asked, "What family estate? That broken-down house?"

The words stung Mu Jie with a dull ache. He once had a family estate, right where Pure Dew Temple now stood. There had been a grand road wide enough for two carriages abreast and rows of magnificent manor houses. Guards stood on the walls while he flew kites with his cousin, and servants would call after him, urging him to eat his meals.

In the summer, there was ice-cold watermelon pulled from the well, its flesh and sweet juice filling his mouth, but he would take only two bites before tossing it on the table because he wanted the lychees sent from the south even more.

But he didn't blame Zhang Jizhi. He was the son of the abbot of Pure Dew Temple; he had never experienced such things.

When he was fifteen, Ziqiu took Mu Jie to his father's grave.

Besides flowers and vegetarian offerings, Ziqiu had also prepared a plate of Kung Pao chicken, a bowl of braised pork knuckle, a bowl of abalone and shark fin soup, and a bottle of Shaoxing wine.

For a monk to offer such meat dishes was truly incongruous.

But he knew, his mother had told him, these were all his father's favorite foods. It was just that now, he himself rarely had the chance to eat such things.

Ziqiu bowed deeply to Mu Qing's grave, then pulled Mu Jie down to kowtow three times before letting him sit.

"I've never told you how your father died," Ziqiu said. "Do you want to know?"

"The Mount Song Sect killed him," Mu Jie said. "They set fire to the Mu Family Manor and killed my father."

"To say the Mount Song Sect killed him is mostly correct, but not entirely," Ziqiu said. "The fire that killed your father was not set by the Mount Song Sect."

Mu Jie was stunned. "If not the Mount Song Sect, then who?" As he spoke, a thought seemed to strike him, and he looked at his master in horror.

Ziqiu said, "The Mount Song Sect knew we would gather at the Mu Family Manor to attack their rear, so they dispatched seven hundred disciples from Mount Song, along with four hundred Taishan disciples from Shandong, to completely surround the manor. At that time, there were only about one hundred and twenty Shaolin disciples defending the manor. To fight a thousand with only a hundred, even with the topographical advantage of the manor, was a battle doomed to fail."

Mu Jie asked, "Weren't there supposed to be reinforcements? Weren't the Shaolin disciples supposed to gather in Kaifeng to cut off Mount Song's retreat?"

"There were never going to be any reinforcements." Ziqiu shook his head, considered for a moment, and continued, "I deliberately leaked that false information to the Mount Song Sect. From the very beginning, the only ones defending Kaifeng were the first hundred or so disciples who arrived, and me."

Mu Jie was first confused, then it dawned on him. "It was bait?"

Ziqiu said, "It was more than just bait." He thought for a moment, then added, "To lift the siege of Shaolin, we had to divide the forces of the Mount Song Sect. As soon as we entered the Mu Family Manor, besides defending the walls, we spread straw, flammable oil, and all sorts of combustibles everywhere. Your father took one look and knew what we were planning."

Mu Jie said, "You were going to burn the manor?!"

Ziqiu nodded. "You are very clever. If only Jizhi were half as clever and hardworking as you."

He sighed. It was only when speaking of his son that he couldn't help but sigh. He spoke of the events at the Mu Family Manor as if it were an ordinary matter. 

"Your father tried to stop us, but I refused. We wanted him to leave, but he wouldn't. He said this place was the fruit of thirty years of the Mu family's labor, that he had watched the high towers rise with his own eyes and must also watch them fall."

"The day before the army arrived, we wanted to take him away by force. He first pleaded with us, then threatened to kill himself. He also said that if he left the manor, he would shout it for all to hear, and finally threatened to set himself on fire. The manor was filled with flammable materials; a single spark would have been enough to cause a catastrophe and ruin our plan. I respected his determination and agreed to let him stay."

As Mu Jie listened, he had already guessed what happened next.

"We lay in ambush outside the walls while your father, after closing the gates, stood guard in your former home—the very spot where Pure Dew Temple now stands—waiting for the disciples of the Mount Song Sect to breach the entrance. They charged in to find an empty city, and before they could even find your father, our hundred or so men secured the front and rear gates and fired flaming arrows into the city, instantly sending flames soaring to the sky. The panicked Mount Song disciples tried to flee but were blocked by us at the gates, unable to advance or retreat, and were either captured or killed, so that of their more than one thousand disciples, only a hundred or so luckily escaped, and the Mu Family Manor was reduced to scorched earth."

"So the 'pure dew' of Pure Dew Temple was meant to extinguish the fire on my father," Mu Jie said. "Is it to commemorate my father's sacrifice, and the foundation built by the six hundred members of the Mu family?"

"Your father was a devout believer. It is said he was chanting the Buddha's name when he died and passed away peacefully."

Mu Jie shook his head. "That's impossible. My father believed in Buddhism, but he wasn't that devout. Burned by a raging fire, his death must have been agonizing."

Ziqiu did not deny Mu Jie's words, only asking, "Is there anything else you want to ask about your father?"

Mu Jie asked, "Master said that the Mount Song Sect being responsible for my father's death was only mostly correct, not entirely. The remaining part, is that you, Master?"

"Though I have regrets, even if I could do it ten times over, I would still set the fire. What must be done, must be done. Your father's death cannot be blamed on me."

"Then who is responsible for the other small part?" Mu Jie asked. "Is my father to blame for his own stubbornness?"

Ziqiu pointed vaguely to the west. "It's that bunch of monks at Shaolin Temple."

Mu Jie asked, "How can you say it was Shaolin Temple's fault?"

"If not for their incompetence and ineptitude, how could Mount Song have grown so powerful? How could the Shao-Song Conflict have been provoked, causing so many deaths? What can those monks who chant the Buddha's name do besides pray? Rely on the Buddha to protect Shaolin, to protect Kaifeng, to protect the people of the four provinces under Shaolin's jurisdiction?" Ziqiu grew more and more indignant as he spoke, until he was gnashing his teeth.

It was the first time Mu Jie had seen his master so furious and agitated, and the first time he had heard a monk curse Shaolin, and even the Buddha, so vehemently. Although he had long suspected that his master was no ordinary monk.

"At a time of life and death, they still require lay disciples to be ordained and enter the halls before they can command in battle and lead their junior brothers. That bunch of incompetent monks, they are the other half responsible for your father's death! Mu Jie, you must remember, to let power fall into the hands of the incompetent is a disaster; it will be the death of innocent people like your father! You must remember that it is not the Buddha who protects the people of these four provinces, but Shaolin Temple! You must remember..."

And then he heard the phrase, the most heretical statement for Shaolin Temple:

"The Buddha may perish, but Shaolin must not!"

Mu Jie did not blame his master. He knew his master was right.

When Mu Jie was seventeen, Zhang Jizhi was as lazy as ever. He had not inherited his father's intelligence; in both martial arts and literary studies, he was left far behind by Mu Jie.

Even without a father's guidance, and despite having the same master, Mu Jie always walked straight, sat steady, and acted with propriety. As he grew older, Mu Jie's gaze became sharper. What Zhang Jizhi didn't know was that many years later, this sharp gaze would turn steady, then profound, until it was like a bottomless pool that inspired awe in all who beheld it.

Zhang Jizhi felt a little jealous, because his father also entrusted Mu Jie with the temple's important affairs, including patrolling Kaifeng.

Ten years after the Shao-Song Conflict, although the Mount Song Sect had mostly submitted, there were still remnants who harbored the delusions of the past. They had publicly severed ties with Mount Song, but in reality, they lurked in the shadows, constantly causing trouble and destruction in an attempt to deplete Shaolin's strength and fulfill their great wish: for Mount Song to break away from Shaolin and become an independent sect.

Mu Jie did not disappoint Ziqiu. After only a month of patrols, he caught seven disciples who had deserted Mount Song by following a trail of clues. At that time, these men were preparing to set fire to Pure Dew Temple in a night raid, their target being the assassination of Ziqiu.

After capturing the seven, Ziqiu interrogated them and, without even reporting to Shaolin Temple, had them all beheaded. He not only hung their heads on the city wall but also had their bodies flayed and hung the bloody remains from seven long bamboo poles.

Zhang Jizhi found it disgusting and said to his father, "You could have just killed them. Doing this is too cruel."

Ziqiu sighed and shook his head at Zhang Jizhi, as if too weary to even explain. He turned to Mu Jie and asked, "You tell me, is it cruel?"

"Killing one to warn a hundred is the only way to deter others, to at least make their accomplices dare not encroach upon Kaifeng's territory again."

Zhang Jizhi said, "What if they come for revenge? Our Shaolin is an orthodox Buddhist sect, and our Buddha is merciful..."

Before he could finish, Ziqiu roared, "Shut up!"

Zhang Jizhi was stunned, and Ziqiu continued, "Wait until they have killed someone in Kaifeng, then you can talk about cruelty! What is cruelty? To die innocent, that is cruelty!"

Ziqiu rarely raised his voice at Zhang Jizhi. After that shout, Zhang Jizhi dared not speak again, only muttering, "Father's lesson is noted..."

Ziqiu said, "If they dare to come again, all the better. We will eliminate them all, to the great satisfaction of the people." After speaking, he turned to Mu Jie. "You, come with me."

Mu Jie nodded and followed.

The two walked outside the old city of Kaifeng, the ancient walls bearing the mottled marks of time. Mu Jie looked at his master; ten years had passed, and his back seemed a little stooped.

"Do you know why, during the Shao-Song Conflict, when the Mount Song Sect had surrounded Shaolin Temple, Cao Lingxue delayed his attack for so long?"

Ziqiu suddenly posed a question that had long been one of the great unsolved mysteries of the martial world. No one knew Cao Lingxue's intention in besieging without attacking; it was only considered a great strategic blunder on his part, and even the key to Shaolin's eventual comeback victory.

Seeing Mu Jie didn't answer, Ziqiu continued, "Because conquering Shaolin would have been useless. Shaolin is the number one sect in the world today; he couldn't swallow it. Once he destroyed Shaolin, the backlash from its disciples would be enough to annihilate the Mount Song Sect."

"If he could neither win by advancing nor succeed by retreating, how was this Shao-Song Conflict supposed to end, and why was it fought at all?" Mu Jie asked in return.

"Besides wanting Shaolin to recognize Mount Song as an independent sect, he also hoped to become the tenth Great Family. He was waiting for someone to mediate. As long as the Nine Great Families intervened, he could use Shaolin as a threat to make the other eight families acknowledge him. Then he could lift the siege of Shaolin, not only legitimizing his actions but also achieving his goal."

"No other sect intervened," Mu Jie said. "The major sects all acted as if it wasn't happening."

Ziqiu said, "This matter must be explained from two perspectives. First, the Nine Great Families. They all knew in their hearts that the Kunlun council was for nine families, and the leader was chosen from among the nine. One more family meant one less share of their own interests. Although Mount Song was powerful, how could it compare to the Beggar's Sect, Kongtong, Diancang, or Wudang? Shaolin and Wudang were close, and Gu Song might have helped, but he was at Kunlun, and Gu Xu dared not make such a decision. If Kunlun did not intervene, the other eight families certainly would not."

Mu Jie said, "Cao Lingxue planned for a long time. How could he dare to stir up conflict without some certainty of success? He would never make such a mistake."

Ziqiu said, "This brings us to the second matter. Mount Song was merely a sect under Shaolin. When they held a martial world banquet, the other sects would at most send disciples to present gifts and offer congratulations, just to be polite. The Beggar's Sect went so far as to send Peng Laogai, who was then just a branch leader in Fuzhou..."

The name Peng Laogai was no longer unfamiliar to Mu Jie. It was a name that brought a rare look of respect to his self-assured master's face when he recounted tales of the martial world. Peng Laogai had only been promoted to the Jiangxi chief leader a few years ago and was the one person among the Nine Great Families most deserving of, and perhaps the only one who truly deserved, the title of "great hero."

"Only Mount Hua sent the sect leader's own younger brother, Yan Yingqi. Why was that?" Ziqiu asked.

Mu Jie had a sudden realization. "They were in collusion from the start. This was premeditated."

"Mount Hua and Shaolin have always had territorial disputes in Shanxi. Cao Lingxue promised that after the matter was settled, he would use the pretext of rewarding them for their mediation to pressure Shaolin into ceding the disputed territories to Mount Hua in exchange for their intervention. But one sect was not enough. After leaving Mount Song, Yan Yingqi went to Wudang to act as a lobbyist for Mount Song. Gu Xu might not have been able to make the final decision, but he could have mediated and waited for Gu Song to intervene. Gu Song was the current leader of the council; his intervention would mean the Kunlun council's intervention. In this way, Cao Lingxue could have achieved his goal, using the withdrawal of the siege as a bargaining chip to gain the status of the tenth Great Family at the Kunlun council."

After saying this, Ziqiu burst into laughter.

"Who would have thought that idiot Yan Yingqi had always been a lecher and took a fancy to a woman on his way to Wudang, ruining her reputation. The woman, unable to bear the shame, hanged herself, and a small sect under Wudang called the Xianxia Sect found out. The Xianxia Sect leader, Yang Jingyao, was a true man. He chased Yan Yingqi all the way to Shanxi, and in their fight, Yan Yingqi was no match for him and was killed. Naturally, the message never reached Wudang."

He laughed heartily again, then continued, "Unfortunately, Yang Jingyao didn't know the whole story, only that Mount Hua was the most vengeful of sects. 'A drop of Mount Hua blood, a head in the martial world.' Fearing retaliation, he disbanded the Xianxia Sect, settled his family, and went to Mount Hua alone to accept punishment. Yan Yingqi's misdeeds were known throughout the martial world; if he weren't the brother of the Mount Hua sect leader, it's doubtful he would have lived past twenty-five. Mount Hua was in the wrong, but they feared Yang Jingyao knew something from Yan Yingqi, so they silenced him by killing him and even issued a feud notice to cover their tracks. A pity for a man as upright as Yang Jingyao... Just now, Jizhi spoke of cruelty. What is cruelty? This is cruelty!"

Only then did Mu Jie understand everything.

"The Xianxia Sect was under Wudang, and Daoist Master Gu Song had always valued Yang Jingyao's talent. After this incident, while he was still the leader of the Kunlun council, he established a new rule. The crime of rape, which was previously punished by the individual sects, was now a great crime to be punished by the entire martial world."

"How did Master connect all these events?"

"How could I have figured it out? Cao Lingxue confessed it himself. He's still a guest at Shaolin Temple." Ziqiu said, "He loves Shaolin so much, he besieged it for half a year. He won't be leaving for the rest of his life."

Mu Jie asked, "Even if Yan Yingqi bungled things, the Shao-Song Conflict lasted eight months. News should have reached Kunlun long before then. Why did Daoist Master Gu Song not intervene for so long?"

At this point, realization dawned on him. He looked at Ziqiu and said, "Master, it was you who stopped Daoist Master Gu Song, who prevented Kunlun from interfering in the Shao-Song Conflict?"

Ziqiu looked at Mu Jie and sighed again. Mu Jie knew he was thinking of Zhang Jizhi again.

Ziqiu said, "Mount Song could not win, and they could not retreat. Shaolin was certain to win this battle. Since that was the case, why let Kunlun intervene and allow Mount Song to profit?"

He thought for a moment, then continued, "You are a hundred times more intelligent than Jizhi, and your temperament is far more resilient. Have you... considered becoming a monk?"

Mu Jie replied, "I am an only son."

Ziqiu said, "An only son is fine. You can be a monk like me."

Only then did Mu Jie learn that to save Shaolin, five lay disciples had been ordained and entered the halls. Ziqiu was the leader of these five, known in the martial world as the 'Iron Brush Painting the Tides,' Zhang Qiuchi, a genius of both courage and strategy, and the key figure in Shaolin's victory.

After the great Shao-Song war, the other four secular monks remained at Shaolin to handle temple affairs. Only Ziqiu was unwilling to stay and came to Kaifeng to serve as the abbot of Pure Dew Temple. Firstly, Kaifeng was the border between Shandong and Henan, allowing him to monitor Mount Song from close by. Secondly, he detested the customs of Shaolin. And thirdly, there was also a small intention of finding Mu Qing's descendants.

Ziqiu said, "In the Shao-Song Conflict, the overt struggle was martial combat, but beneath the surface, there were many hidden currents. This unseen struggle is often a hundred times more perilous than the open fights. One wrong step, and the entire game is lost. You must think three times, four times, ten times, a hundred times, until there are no omissions, before you can take a single step."

Mu Jie nodded and said, "Disciple understands."

"Everything I have will be given to you in the future." Ziqiu patted Mu Jie's shoulder. "Shaolin's future is in your hands."

From then on, Ziqiu handed over all temple affairs to Mu Jie and, disregarding Shaolin's rules, passed on his entire body of martial arts to him. As for Zhang Jizhi, Ziqiu seemed to have given up on him, no longer requiring him to practice martial arts or urging him to study. Zhang Jizhi also grew distant from Mu Jie; they would often pass each other without even a greeting, simply turning their heads and walking away, and Mu Jie paid it no mind.

But Ziqiu's health seemed to be gradually failing. Two years later, Ziqiu suffered a stroke and nearly died. Although he was saved, he was bedridden from then on and never rose again.

He had finally grown old.

Seeing Ziqiu fall ill, Mrs. Mu also began to worry about her own health and often urged Mu Jie to marry, but Mu Jie was reluctant to agree.

After Ziqiu fell ill, Pure Dew Temple was entirely managed by Mu Jie. Letters would often arrive from Shaolin Temple concerning difficult matters that required Ziqiu's judgment, and Mu Jie would reply to them all. His methods were swift and his insights brilliant; no one ever suspected the letters were not from Ziqiu's own hand.

Another year passed, and Mu Jie noticed that some awkward figures had reappeared in Kaifeng, stirring up trouble.

'It's that pack of bastards from Mount Song again,' Mu Jie thought.

One day, Mu Jie rose at the fourth watch to handle affairs at Pure Dew Temple. As he reached the door, he saw that the lock was askew.

He had always been meticulous and self-disciplined; when he left, he would lock the door and ensure the lock was perfectly straight, without the slightest deviation. A crooked lock meant it had been tampered with. Only he and his master had keys to this lock. Could it be that his master had been here?

He remained on high alert, unlocked the door, and just as he pushed it open, a flash of white light cleaved toward his face. Mu Jie was already prepared and sidestepped to avoid it. Four masked assassins surrounded him; one of them, with a slender and well-proportioned figure, was actually a woman.

Mu Jie was only twenty at the time. He fought one against four, shouting for help. Before long, the Proctor Monks of Pure Dew Temple arrived, and a dozen monks surrounded the four assailants.

One of them yelled, "Retreat!"

The voice was very familiar. The four tried to break through the encirclement but were blocked by the monks and could not escape. It wasn't long before they were captured one by one.

Mu Jie stopped the one who had shouted to retreat and pulled off his mask.

It was, indeed, Zhang Jizhi.

Zhang Jizhi stammered, "Junior Brother, spare me! Junior Brother... I... I didn't mean to, I was forced!..."

The woman cursed, "What are you begging him for? Mu Jie, you son of a bitch, you cost my Songyang Sect seven lives! That coward Han Moying is afraid of you, but the good men of Songyang are not afraid to die!"

Zhang Jizhi swore back, "You bitch, shut up!"

Then he turned and pleaded, "Don't let my father know! Junior Brother... I beg you, spare my life, spare my life..."

Mu Jie slowly closed his eyes, as if in thought. The north wind howled, and snow began to fall.

※

"I'm begging you, spare his life." On his sickbed, Ziqiu pleaded mournfully. This hero, who had once presided over the great Shao-Song war, a man of both courage and wisdom, was now just an old father, beseeching with a feeble voice, his eyes devoid of their former brilliance.

He grabbed Mu Jie's shoulder and tumbled from the bed to his knees. Mu Jie tried to help him up, but he pressed his head to the floor.

"He's my only son, my only bloodline! He's your senior brother, you grew up together! You practiced martial arts together, sparred together, ate from the same pot, drank from the same bowl!"

They both knew why Zhang Jizhi had colluded with the remnants of Mount Song, committing the great crime of betraying Shaolin and attempting to assassinate a fellow disciple. But it was too late to investigate the reasons.

He shouted with all his might, though his breath was as faint as a thread.

But he heard no response from Mu Jie.

Ziqiu raised his head. He saw a straight back and a resolute, lean face. That tall frame... yes, at some point, Mu Jie had grown much taller than him. Those eyes, which once held a sharp edge, had now matured and become restrained.

Zhang Jizhi could not be allowed to live. The son of the Shaolin hero Zhang Qiuchi joining the ranks of the Mount Song Sect to oppose Shaolin—what a great irony that would be.

If he did not die, it would shake the authority and prestige of Shaolin's laws.

If even Zhang Qiuchi's son had to die for breaking the rules, who else would dare to harbor thoughts of betrayal?

Mu Jie said only one sentence. The very sentence, once spoken by his master, that had stirred him to his core:

"The Buddha may perish, but Shaolin must not."

Ziqiu collapsed to the floor, wailing and beating his chest.

Zhang Jizhi was sentenced to immediate execution. He was not sent back to Shaolin but was executed directly in Kaifeng, by Mu Jie's own hand. He allowed Zhang Jizhi to pass without a trace of pain, as if in a deep sleep.

Zhang Jizhi's mother, Ziqiu's wife, left Kaifeng as soon as she heard the verdict. A white-haired mother sending off her black-haired son, she could not bear to accompany her beloved child on his final journey. She never returned.

The remaining three assassins did not die. The following night, a masked person broke in, secretly opened the cells, and released the three of them.

They called themselves the Songyang Sect, a name Mount Song was forbidden to use. They were the radicals within Mount Song who were unwilling to submit to Shaolin. From their words, one could discern their dissatisfaction with the current sect leader, Han Moying.

Shaolin could withstand their attacks, but could Mount Song withstand their internal strife? If they were allowed to grow stronger, they would become a faction within the Mount Song Sect that opposed Mount Song itself. They would become dissatisfied with the governance of Han Moying and his followers, turning on Mount Song and causing its decline. A weakened Mount Song would no longer have the strength to threaten Shaolin.

The struggle beneath the surface was far more perilous than the martial combat on stage. He had been lifted up by the hands of the 'Iron Brush Painting the Tides,' Zhang Qiuchi, and he had to do even better than him. His vision had to be broader, his sight wider, more thorough, and his methods more cunning.

In the last year of his life, Ziqiu transferred all his books and contacts to Mu Jie, giving him everything without reservation. Only his status was something Mu Jie had to climb to, step by step, on his own merit.

He placed all his hopes in Mu Jie, expecting him to become the next leader of the secular monks after himself.

Then he died. In his final moments, his lips moved, but his words were unclear. Mu Jie leaned in close and could only hear a faint murmur, endlessly repeating, "Jizhi... Jizhi... Jizhi..."

Afterward, Mu Jie remained at Pure Dew Temple, planning for Shaolin as a lay disciple.

At the age of twenty-five, Mu Jie married the niece of the Kongtong sect leader and had three sons and a daughter, securing the Mu family line.

At the age of twenty-eight, Mrs. Mu's wish was fulfilled. She passed away with a smile, holding her grandson. Mu Jie became one of Shaolin's In-Hall Laymen, implicitly becoming the leader of the secular monks.

It was not until he was forty that Mu Jie was formally ordained and entered the hall. He was of Ziqiu's lineage and, according to seniority, served successively as a Hall Monk in the Hall of True Progress and as the abbot of the Hall of True Speech. In just a few short years, he became the first seat of the Universal Virtue Court.

Experience was merely a process for him. Even if he hadn't become the first seat of the Universal Virtue Court, no one would have doubted his position.

The foremost among the secular monks: Juekong.
